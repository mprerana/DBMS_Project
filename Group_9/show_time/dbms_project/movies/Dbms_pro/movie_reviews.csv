Avengers: Endgame,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself.",5
Avengers: Endgame,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",5
Avengers: Endgame,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",5
Avengers: Endgame,"This is probably the highest 8/10 I could give for an 8/10 movie.There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds.Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well.Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion.",4
Avengers: Endgame,Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!,5
Avengers: Endgame,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.",3
Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.,5
Avengers: Endgame,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!",5
Avengers: Endgame,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.",5
Avengers: Endgame,"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!",5
Avengers: Endgame,"So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Unpopular opinion.
Let me start by saying that Endgame is not a bad film. In fact it was a decent film. But nothing more. Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype.
The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place.
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It's like the writers didn't care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments. Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes.
Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this.
The last battle was epic and beautiful but that's all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.
Also, the way they ended Cap's story, meh... Yeah we got it, you want to make people cry and give us the end of an era, but at least do it without creating dozens of plot holes.
The 3 hours went by fast, but I wouldn't watch it again in theaters (I had planned to watch it at least 1 more time).
This could be so damn good... Disappointed.*edit* Also, all of you fanboys who downvote all my reviews because you got angry because I gave your beloved Avengers a 6, you are just amusing and pathetic. Get a life.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives:
RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives:
Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",4
Avengers: Endgame,This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.,5
Avengers: Endgame,"*Packed with MANY spoilers*Let's get real. This movie was so massive, but it has sooo many plotholes! Make no mistake I love Marvel, but this movie was not the best that's out there from the MCU. I loved how the movie pays homage to the previous films, I thought that was quite clever. But I personally expected way more action earlier in the movie.Thanos snapped half the universe in IW. But we didn't really get to SEE the direct impact on Earth in this movie. No chaos. No news. Just a ... quiet depressed world? Really? I wanted to feel anxious and feel like all hope is lost but it never really got there. Even during collecting the stones from the previous timelines.The attack on Thanos in the opening scene was lame. This guy was meant to be a massive villain that the MCU has been building up for a decade, and his death was over in minutes. Captain Marvel's lack of screen time didn't make any sense, she's so powerful yet was hardly there. I get that the writers were focusing on the original 6 Avengers but there were scenes where it would have been interesting to see her in. Yes, this is the Avengers fight, but it's also Captain Marvels universe that has been affected, so not seeing her as involved as Ant-Man or Nebula was disappointing. Oh and obtaining the Soul stone... Nebula couldn't warn Black Widow and Hawkeye about what was coming? Seriously?? Not something you want to mention beforehand?How did Thanos's ship time travel without a) starks tech and b) the Pym Particle. HELLO THE SHIP WENT SUB ATOMIC INTO THE QUANTAM REALM AND TIME TRAVELLED. What did the 2014 Nebula do to make this happen? And no one noticed a massive ship come shooting out of the time machine and out of the Avengers base?!When Hulk reverses the snap... again we don't know the impact it had on Earth / the Universe. What actually happened? Was everything reset back to 2019, or were the people that turned to dust returned into a new time (5 years later?) and if so why was Peter back in highschool?? And what about the people that were already on Earth, were they also set back to a time right before everyone dissappeared? I guess we see Cassie (Ant-Man) all grown up at the end, but come on... this was a MASSIVE ISSUE and it was not explained in any way whatsoever. I get they wanted the dramatic entrance of the dusted superheroes, but even after the mega action scene at the end there was no explanation of how half the universe came back into life.The movie also never really showed us as an audience the 1 in 14 million ... chain of events that led to the win. Could anyone else have snapped their fingers and dusted away Thanos and his clan? Again... no proper explanation.Tony stark starting the MCU infinity saga and also ended it, perfect... and giving him the appropriate screen time at the end. What about black widow? Couldn't Hawkeye bring her body back? Couldn't someone else travel to where she was and get her body? They just left her there to die alone?For a 3 hour movie you'd expect more of closing story or better explanations, but instead time was wasted on a slow start to the movie. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this movie and it will come to grow on me more and more, but I'm always going to have these questions in the back of my mind every time I watch.Oh... and don't get me started on the time travel MESS.",4
Avengers: Endgame,I live Marvel .I love Superheroes.I love MCU and I loved Infinity War.The way I left the hall after I watched Infinity and The way I left the hall AFTER watching Endgane was completely different.So much hype and well deserved too but the ending was just not satisfactory at all.I liked bits of it but the other bit I just forced myself to like it just because I've been a fan of the creators and the actors and the characters for so long.But no It was not what I wanted not what we deserved.,4
Avengers: Endgame,Anyone of Thor's fans wouldn't accept Marvel's adaptation of Thor. They ruined Thor this character just for making him as the funny elements of the film,4
Avengers: Endgame,"2,5 hours of nonsense and gigantic plotholes. 15 minutes of action which is a total mess. CGI looks good, bit dark. Thor, one of the strongest badass characters in Marvel Universe is a drunk fat dude, does not make sense. Cap. America who can use Thors Hammer suddenly with lightning abilities, why? Cap. Marvel is OP, shows up randomly does huge amounts of damage and dissapears again list goes on and on... Iron man is the only character in this movie who deservers credits in my opinion. Infinity war is way better, its really overrated.",3
Avengers: Endgame,"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"Not sure if it's a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered reviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not stunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasn't funny or jokes that were somehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the overall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as always, it's down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are too many things, that were illogical:
Nebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the end-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thor's hammerCaptain America living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead heros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you haven't seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and everyone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character developments I also did not like.Personally didn't like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his story was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The hairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, let's not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic, overall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, it's a combination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didn't do the trick for me to make it an epic movie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least somehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie.",4
Avengers: Endgame,"I'm not even sure where to start. I had high expectations ever since I've walked out from IW premiere. Those expectations are further fueled up by all the good reviews and 10/10 ratings this movie received. But, after watching a movie, I'm quite sure that all those reviews and ratings have been sponsored. There is no other explanation. I've also heard stories about people crying, laughing and cheering throughout the movie and giving standing ovations after the movie ended. I'm not sure are those stories made up or what, but in theater where I was, we had like two laughs, some WTFs, multiple yawns and not much else. As matter a fact, I've never seen so many people playing with their phones during a Marvel movie. Never ever. It was that boring.Now, don't get me wrong, the movie is somewhat watchable, but I beleive the fans deserved much more than ""watchable"" for this final installment of the franchise. I could basically write a book about what's wrong with this movie, but won't as I've already spend too much time on this abomination. What's the use of it anyway. Fanboys will praise this movie no matter what and disregard all the arguments against it. Movie creators are already counting all the billions they've earned by breaking every box office record there is. The only ""victims"" here are the true fans who actually appreciate Stan Lee's life work, but they probably already share my opinion anyway. I will, however, throw down a few things that ruined this movie for me, just so I can take it off my chest.Action balance is terrible. In the first 2 hours, basically nothing happens and what does happen makes no sense. There is almost no action and the storyline is all over the place. And then, all of a sudden the whole hell breaks loose. That wouldn't be so bad if the final batlle was spectacular as it should be, but it wasn't. It was a 15 minutes of pure chaos and CGI showcase. It wasn't clear who does what, who fights who... no coreography, no signature moves... nothing.Screen time balance was terible as well. I understand the idea to focus on the original avengers squad, but that's not the reason to give like 90% of the screen time to them (with addition of Ant-man) and like 10% to other 50 characters in the MCU. Basically, no one got more than 60 seconds of total screen time, including Captain Marvel who supposed to be a big part of the movie. With most characters, it felt more like a slide show of cameos, rather than integral part of the story.Most of the characters from the original avengers squad are ruined. I understand that they needed to close their story arc somehow, but was this the right way? Should it be this anti-climactic? Captain America turning into a grandpa? Mighty Hulk becoming clumsy scientest who won't even fight anymore? I kid you not, he didn't throw a single punch the entire move. He basically became the most useless character in MCU. Thor becoming a fat, depressed alcoholic who plays Fortnite and argues with kids on the Internet? Really? The god of thunder? Black Widow meeting the most anti-climactic end imaginable? Couldn't she at least have one more fight scene with her signature moves as we've seen in some previous MCU movies? Couldn't Hulk have at least one more ""Hulk Smash"" moment? Couldn't Hawkeye show off his archery skills once again? Shouldn't they go with a bang? They deserved it and the fans deserved it.Why there is no consistency with most character's powers. I mean, at one moment it looks like Captain Marvel can destroy Thanos and his entire army all by herself, but the next one she looks like a houswive who can be thrown around by her drunk husbend with a bad attitude. The same goes for Scarlett Witch. Also, it looks like any character has more chance to win when fighting Thanos alone than they do when going 10 on one. Just makes no sense.Everything looks rushed up. The main story is all over the place. The entire time travel plot is a mess. Fight scenes are not coreographed well, so it's difficult to follow what's going on most of the time. There is no character development. They just pop up out of nowhere. Humor is forced and out of the place most of the time.I guess the movie creators just wanted to add too much into this movie, but achieved quite the opposite result. Anyway, the best course of action would be to rename this move to ""Iron man 4"" and create another Avengers movie, but do it properly this time.",2
Avengers: Endgame,"Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours.",2
Jersey,"What to start with the directors vision or the actors performances.
As a 90's kid i know that old days where watching news in durdarshan spider man in the tv after the school. Playing cricket with friends. Those are the best days. By watching the movie i got to recollect those old memories..
To the story a failed man want to try once again his luck by giving his full strength at the age of 36 to show the world what is and what he can do. Man NANI what an actor you are i had to say that i saw only arjun on the screen the way you pulled the character is beyond words.. the scene where "" crying your lungs out in the railway station in loud sound"" kudos to you.. and the directors work of showing cricket in where it is needed not getting away with it, giving important to the emotions, shows his strength of telling a story. And about music Anirudh lifted the movie to whole new level with his commendable Bgm. Songs blended in the movie so well that it doesn't look like a hurdle inbetween like movies we regularly watch in telugu. If haven't mention wbout the kid, shradha, satyaraj garu ot would be a mistake. They stayed in my head as nani, Sarah and murthy garu.
After watching i have mixed feelings. I just had a journey with arjun's character i felt his pain, anger, struggle, joy.
RARELY WE SEE THESE KIND OF MOVIES AND PERFORMANCES IN TELUGU CINEMA GO AND WATCH IT WITH YOUR FAMILY. SURE YOU WILL NOT HAVE A EMOTIONAL JOURNEY.",5
Jersey,"Jersey is an emotional heart touching movie which is serious in nature,gowtham tinnuri proved himself again after Mallirava..jersey was a complete movie with everything in it,but I felt director would have taken more depth in the way cricket was presented in the movie.
Jersey passes everything & its a must watch for telugu audience.",5
Jersey,"One of the best movie in recent times. Director Gautam Tinnanuri has delivered an excellent film and has used his abilities perfectly for his second film too. The screen play for this movie also looks similar as his first movie Malli Raava. Subtle performances by the cast Nani and Shraddha Srinath. Supporting cast Sathya Raj, Praveen etc. have also played their role with so much of life. The emotions between the Father and Son Relation is brought up amazingly. The climax is the Heart of the film. Music Director Anirudh Ravichander has given his one of the best ever songs and beautiful Background Score. Magical Scenes in some important and emotional places. The subtitle of this film ""It is never too late to dream.!"" is brought up beautifully in the climax. The only drawback I feel as a movie freak is the lack of concentration on the cricketing scenes and quite the story becomes a bit predictable. But totally a package of love, emotion, passion, journey. Must Watch Film for everyone.
Thanks,
Vijay Kashyap",5
Jersey,Nani lived in the role of Arjun. I felt every single emotion of Arjun. You experience a rollercoaster ride of emotions. The way the Director narrated the movie made every possible impact to me. Nani- Awards 2019 await you...,5
Jersey,Different and amazing story. actors are done awesome job. best supporting actor will be sathyaraj garu. And emotion will be in many scenes. you will be nani's fan after watch of this film. i love shraddha srinidhi a lot.,5
Jersey,"One of the finest movie in terms of direction, casting, screenplay, music, editing and most importantly, inspirational. It's never too late to dream and achieve.",5
Jersey,Best emotional and motivational movie ever made in India. Compared to Hollywood best in this zoner,5
Jersey,First I need congratulate the director what a film brother never expected such a great movie from debut director. Nani you are awesome bro. Award winning performance. Congrats to the whole team.,5
Jersey,"Nani , made men cry in theaters, for the touching subtle yet emotional outburst.
Salutes to Gautsm Tinnanuri directorial flick. Anirudh music is exceptional .
Must watch for all fathers and dreamers",5
Jersey,"I liked everything about the movie like action, screenplay, direction etc. I don't need to write what I liked about the movie. I didn't like the following points and found this is general theme of movies of Telugu industry .1. Hero looks more self centered and only tried to prove he is good man to his son at the expense of his health.2. He lost his life to impress his son and left the family with no support.3. By hiding his health problem, he left his family guilty after his death.4. True love is take care of his health and also support his family, not trying to impress his son alone .5. Hiding the health issue, hero proved he is great and good, and all others wrong and bad.6. Whole team failed but only hero single handed my won the match.",4
Jersey,"The film is based on a fictional character arjun an ex-ranji cricketer who wants to play cricket again for his son. Director Goutham tinnanuri handled every emotion well. Actor Nani shines throughout the film making this film a classic. Anirudh returns to tollywood with a bang, music has definetely played a huge role in film's success.",5
Jersey,"Loved every frame of the movie. Kudos to the director's vision. Simple storyline yet beautifully crafted and brilliantly performed!
Undoubtedly best among the best movies of this gen!",5
Jersey,One of the best movies released this year. This is an emotional film which portrays a person who is struggling to make it big in life at a later stage in his life. This film motivates us with a strong message that it's never too late to achieve as long as there's hardwork and dedication.The casting is just perfect with the lead actor Nani delivering an exceptional performance & the music is also brilliant. Don't miss this masterpiece in theater.,5
Jersey,"This movie is one of the master piece in recent years from Telugu Film Industry. Like a Classy batsman when the cricket is played, i could imagine the director role here.
Words are not enough, this is a must watch, i saw this couple of times now, did not felt bored at all.Really a must watch, irrespective of language barrier.",5
Jersey,Superb emotional ride !! Jersey is a emotional roller coaster ride with some awesome scenes !! I'm speechless for the train scene made me very emotional and got goosebumps !! Nani did a splendid job and heroine too and the kid too had done a good job !! Climax made us very emotional left the theatre emotionally!! Overall it is a wonderful emotional film !! Please watch it u too will feel the same.,5
Jersey,Nanis acting at peaks.i never felylt like i was watching a movie.it just felt like real. a soothing screenplay. it will never bore u howmany times u see,5
Jersey,"This a movie of emotions and love between son and father.Nani(Arjun) stole the show.Shradda(Sarah) was amazing.Ronit(Nani) killed with his cute expressions and dialogues.
Full emotional drama package.
Climax was the highlight of the movie.",5
Jersey,A movie with the heart at its place. Watch it for some beautiful writing and great portrayal from the lead actors. You will be moved for sure. Kudos to the whole team.,5
Jersey,"Yes! For who all know Nani... He is back with jersey. This is the film that reaches beyond Your expectations (only if your into drama-movies). You'll smile, cry but come out of the theatre after clapping with a good feel. The music is too good to be noticed it just goes with the flow, we can just feel it. Cinematography is good.",4
Jersey,It's tough to define a genre which suites this movie. A completely off-beat and new kind of a film which would leave you with some satisfaction after you leave the theatre. Credit must go to the director Gowtham garu for such a strong script and excellent characterizations which are very rare in Telugu movies these days. Nani at his best and surely one of the stars in making. Special mention to Satyaraj's ease of acting.He made it look so simple but was very impactful. A must-watch movie in this summer and such movies need to be encouraged for the development of Telugu Industry.,5
Jersey,"This movie will be the best in Nani 's career till date , th emotional content between the father and son will stir your eyes and heart .
Overall very inspiring story with right national
Crested to the entire team , especially the direction department
Keep it up guys",5
Jersey,"Got excited after the first few minutes of the movie.. Was waiting for the pace to pickup or it was something like a plane was on full speed on the runway but failed to takeoff..
..
Overall a good movie which can be watched with entire family..
..
Length of the movie could have been reduced.
..
Extremely relieved that there are no unnecessary songs or dance or action sequences..
..
Female lead voice doesn't sync with lips nor suite her as she is not native Telugu speaker..
..
Nani action and Anirudh music score saves the movie",4
Jersey,Wow wow wow nani tnx very emotional first haif extraordinary nd 2nd haif very very gd,5
Kanchana 3,"As of kanchana franchise this movie will really disappoint you the plot and the sequences are same as in Kanchana movie, nothing will engage and boring film..",2
Kanchana 3,Only can watch for humour. Same old typical storyline.,1
Kanchana 3,"Good Movie at only 1st half. The movie was so boring at 2nd half. The movie was not good as Muni, Kanchana and Kanchana 2. The movie was not worst but somewhat good only because of the performances of Raghava Lawrence, Kovai Sarala, Devadarshini and Sriman. The three heroines were not needed in the movie. Songs were not good in the movie. BGM was good in the movie. The movie has some continuity mistakes. Soori was not at all used in the movie. Many characters were not used well in the movie. The movie was not worst but the movie was good.",3
Kanchana 3,Sequel carrying the same style. but yet it can make us laugh at least at 20 places. but finally whats the point ending up with a super boring flashback and a super idiotic climax. seems like power rangers at the end. people were expecting a little more entertainment. but finally it didn't come up well like kanchana.,3
Kanchana 3,"Unbelievably crappy, loud and annoying with stupid storyline",1
Kanchana 3,"Super entertaining, scary , real ghost effect . Good effort ... enjoy watching .",5
Kanchana 3,"Superb performance by kovai sarala.Loved it
acting-9/10
plot-7.5/10
e value-7/10",5
Kanchana 3,"If you are looking for a family entertainer, this is a good choice. However the story is similar to that of the previous parts, little bit of new elements are added. The horror elements are periodically timed between humour scenes. In fact, the sound makes a horror feel than the visuals. A very good first half and a flash back oriented second part. This is the traditional screenplay of Muni Series. Kanchana 3 also follows this trademark.",5
Kanchana 3,"Fun loaded laughed with tears, as usual Ragava Lawrence has rocked with his dance.Kovai sarala has rocked and Devadharshini has given a best team with her.",5
Kanchana 3,1st half will be good with most horror scenes and comedy. 2nd half lacks a little bit of both. good to watch but not that highly good. It will be better if concept can change.,3
Kanchana 3,"Comedy , horror & entertainment it's here if you bring your mind for serious and art type movie stay at home. This is for masses just sit laugh enjoy and go home ... don't bring your mind to judge something made just to entertain.",5
Kanchana 3,Feels as little disappointment due to over expectation,4
Chitralahari,"The movie connects every youths life....
Messege oriented movie,

I honsetly hope that it should even make a decent collections and I wish the Director & dialogue writer Congratulations for their great future ahead and
Tej even performed well when compared with his previous movies, i hope he keep doing movies like this.",5
Chitralahari,"Beautifully written movie, the dialogues were outstanding. A perfect blend of every emotion, loved the dialogue at the end, ""if a topper succeeds, it's just an accomplishment; if a failure succeeds, it's a history."" Each and every scene in the second half was hard hitting. A must watch one for the people who never quit trying!",5
Majili,"Actually I saw the rating of movie first and then I watched it, hoping it's great, but in reality it's kind of different, the first half was not great it was closed without any proper ending, the chemistry between both the nag and first heroine was completely different from what he gives after love failure, mainly there was no intense feeling and the ending of the movie was even not great I feel it couldn't drag me or any in the theatre to connect to it the way they presented.I probably don't Suggest a second visit",3
Majili,"Love this movie! The story was simple, but was portrayed beautifully. The performances were brilliant and it reminded me of old movies, filled with simplicity throughout. Though it was a long one, never felt bored, definitely a heart winner!",5
Majili,This will become chay career best acting and same Samantha terrific performance loved all technical stuff and cinematography and direction was emotional even Divyansha is perfect to her role overall a emotional and true life film,5
Majili,"Superb acting from naga chaitanya and samantha.
Awesome story.",5
Majili,"Awesome story...... A beautiful and different love emotional family story .......its a great story ,every one rocking in the movie,especially naga chaitanys acting improved compared in past ..finally its pure love story going to a big blockbuster movie",5
Majili,Majili movie is really emotional movie with a dialogues chaitu and divyanksha lived in the acting and shiva nirvaran dialogues and screen play makes the film good,5
Majili,"Majili is probably one of the good performances of Nag Chaitanya,not the best. Samantha did a phenomenal job and protrayed sravani role in a good way. The first half entirely focused on Love story between Chat and Divyansha(She looks beautiful) ,but there is nothing new in that story. We already seen that and been there ,but I didn't felt bored ,thanks to the new face (Divyansha) and songs composed by Gopi Sundar were one of the assets for this movie. Second half , here Chay-Sam factor worked big time and Background score by Thaman was beautiful. Director Shiva nirvana did a good job and his dialogues were good. Suhas as chay friend was good .
Though there are some few flaws in story , majili is a decent watch.",4
Majili,I don't understand how this film has such high rating.Very pathetic extremely disappointed.V bad story line!!! Please don't waste your time watching this film!!,1
Majili,"A very soulful movie with the tagline apt for its plot. Vizag's beauty is beautifully captured and with the accompaniment of the melodic BGM, Majili is a treat for the eyes.
Naga Chaitanya is not a bad actor, in fact through movies like Ye Maya Chesave and 100% love, we can agree that he is decent. The only issue is that he is very monotonous, he's neither improving nor deteriorating. He is consistent with his acting but if he wants to match up to the level of his father and grandfather, he has a long way to go. Thankfully, Majili came to his rescue and became a treat for his fans with some improvements in his acting capabilities. It was a much needed blockbuster for him. His talent truly came out in some scenes where you can justify the nepotism but he is no match for Samanatha. This beauty is one of the best actresses in this generation and she truly convinced us with Shravani. Posani and Rao Ramesh were endearing as always, Subbaraju was unnecessary in the film and Diyanksha made a decent debut.As for the downsides of this film, it has quite a predictable plot, a few unnecessary characters and very superficial knowledge of the game of cricket. Especially the scene where Poorna insults Meera for her grip and shows her the ""correct"" way to grip a cricket bat when it is actually the worst way to grip. He is supposed to be a great player of the game but no knowledge of such basic things put you off. But it's not a film based on cricket (GO WATCH JERSEY FOR THE REAL DEAL) so I guess it ticks a few boxes in the family drama genre. The songs were another let down, Gopi Sundar usually produces classics but except for Priyathama, the rest were not up to par and doesn't leave a mark.Finally, Majili is definitely as one time watch for Chai's improvement and Sam's beautiful acting but if you want to go for a realistic film, miss this one.",4
Majili,"This is for sure, you would be delighted after watching samantha's acting. Life after love failure :-)",5
Majili,Chaitu acting is wonderful and divyanksha and samantha looks beautiful so movie became a wonderful hit,5
Majili,Chaitu did hia job excellent no other hero did this so it looks like fantastic movie he gave to fans a memorable hit,5
Majili,"An alcoholic and a failed cricketer, Poorna is a nuisance in his neighbourhood, burden for his father and a wound that needs to be nursed for his wife. His wound runs deep as its not physical, but an emotional trauma caused by a love story which changes him forever.
Love, heartbreak and cricket is the premise around which Shiva Nirvana builds his latest love story Majili. He builds his characters slowly around this, but for the large part of the film, there's a lot of heartbreak and less love, while cricket is simply shown as an aside - most of it is exaggerated and flawed. Strangely enough, for a love story like Majili, there are a lot of action sequences. It seems people in Vizag, where the film is based, are willing to beat each other up at the drop of a hat. And there's seldom any closure to all the violence. It all seemed part of a mythical 'magic formula' that the director was trying to find. And yet, despite all of this, Majili keeps you interested and entertained for most part of it.",4
Majili,"One of the best in recent times .
Love in it's best form",5
Majili,I felt bored and predictable from Dehradun episode to climax.... Samantha expressions are irritating I think the love story shown in this film is painful and happens in real life too but the married life of the hero is dramatic and missing logic in few scenes but the climax is impressive and melting,3
Kalank,"After Thugs of Hindostan and Zero, another movie which justifies its name...this movie is literally a Kalank in the history of Indian cinema, it was that bad. Save your money for Avengers: Endgame.",1
Kalank,It's slow to the roots. It's boring. Bad screenplay. Bad script. Watch it for the good costumes in it. Well chuck it. Don't even go for it.,1
Kalank,"Nothing new, same wealthy royal family drama because of an outsider. Such a huge budget and star cast wasted. Varun Dhavan failed to deliver weight in acting which his character demands.Sanjay Dutt's personality justifies his role. Alia seems wanabe central character of the film, but fails to be so. The film becomes unbearable even till interval.",2
Kalank,"The movie sets, the costumes, acting of the lead actors were all awesome. The sets were lavish and was a treat on the large screen.
Surprised by so many negative comments, when stupid shahruck and salmon khan movies get ranked much higher - maybe public are not rating movies realistically - I have started to get a feel that clearly user review ratings of Indian movies are not realistic on IMDB.Although It is 8* for me, I had to give it a 10* to improve the IMDB rating of this well-made movie.",5
Kalank,"A typical Bollywood film to make appeal to Pakistani audience.
This film is the same old ""religion"" vs ""humanity"" , where Zafar is of other religion.
my question is why cant Zafar denounce his religion for his loved one?And there is no character development for Zafar.
Direction wise the movie is really bad, probably one of the worst direction of all time.No plot.No character Development.
Only Melodrama.
Director is wannabe SanjayLeelaBansari.
Music is forgettable and Pritam's worst movie as music director.
Like other review says, the film is extremely boring.",1
Kalank,Please don't waste your money and time... totally boring movie,1
Kalank,"This Movie should only be watched if you want to punish yourself by sitting through 3hours of torture. Bland movie, extremely slow, boring,monotonous with weak and predictable story with dose of overacting",1
Kalank,"A VISUALLY STUNNING FILM TOPPED WITH GREAT PERFORMANCESA complex love story set during India's Partition era, where the young Roop (Alia Bhatt) is torn between respect for husband Dev (Aditya Roy Kapur) and her newfound love for Zafar (Varun Dhawan). While their back stories and heart-breaking love saga unfolds, the history of India takes an epic turn, from where there is no coming back
As the name suggests, 'Kalank' is a story that questions the high morals of society, especially when it comes to love and family ties. At the heart of the story, the film focuses on how eternal love goes beyond the norms and rules of society, the trappings of religion, and all other physical and man-made boundaries. At a dramatic moment in the film, Aditya Roy Kapur's Dev remarks that if someone's wife is in love with another man, then what is the point of the marriage at all. In that aspect, writer and director Abhishek Varman's film makes a strong point.The story is based in a town called Husnabad, near Lahore, a few years before the Partition of India and Pakistan. It's a town populated by blacksmiths and a majority of them are Muslims. Husnabad's most affluent family is the Chaudhrys - Dev and his father Balraj (Sanjay Dutt), who also run a liberal newspaper called The Daily News. Dev's life takes a sudden turn when under strange circumstances he gets married to Roop. But the complexities in the story are just about to begin. Without revealing too much, during a visit to Bahaar Begum's chamber (where Roop is honing her music skills) Roop meets Zafar, the local blacksmith and after several meetings they develop strong feelings for each other. The story seems like it offers something new, but the complex relationships and ill-fated romances are often predictable. What's fresh about 'Kalank' is the treatment. This period drama is mounted on a lavish scale and whether it's the sets or the costumes, everything about the film brings the grandeur alive.
While it does make a strong case for the universal nature of love, the film's screenplay at times, becomes a little too indulgent and keeps oscillating between the deft nuances as well as theatrical drama. And yet, there are sublime moments like the uneasy relationship between newly-weds Roop and Dev, the tender exchanges between Satya and Dev and the romantic scenes (topped with intense dialogues) between Roop and Zaffar. The other high points of the film are the problematic equation between father and son, Dev and Balraj as well as the fragile teacher-student dynamic between Bahaar Begum and Roop. What we wish is that the narrative lingered more with such intimate moments that would make us feel more for the characters.The biggest highlight of the film is the star-studded cast and thankfully, the performances measure up to the epic ensemble. Alia Bhatt leads the way in a role that showcases vulnerability and strength in equal measure. Varun Dhawan, flaunting his superbly toned, greased body looks great for the part and he shows immense intensity that his conflicted character demands. Another stand-out performance comes from Aditya Roy Kapur, who excels in the stoic silences and reserved nature of his character. Madhuri Dixit-Nene, Sanjay Dutt and Sonakshi Sinha chip in with moments of pitch-perfect drama, too. Kunal Kemmu as Zafar's friend Abdul, brings in tension and thrills in his grey-shaded role. The joint efforts of the cast add the proverbial punch to the experience of 'Kalank'.An epic love saga based during the 1940s has so much scope for visual detailing and finesse. While 'Kalank' scales up the production in every aspect, at times, the world that it recreates looks a little too plush and away from reality. The film features arresting frames full of grand visuals captured by cinematographer Binod Pradhan, and the music by Pritam has stand out songs like 'Ghar More Pardesiya' and the 'Kalank' title track. At 2 hours and 48 minutes, with a tighter edit the story could have wrapped up much sooner though. 'Kalank' is a true labour of love that tells you a story laced with beautiful moments that will tug at your heartstrings.",4
Kalank,Story: You know it already from the trailer.Making: It's very grand and huge in scale.Acting: Only Alia Bhat acts in this whole movie.Direction: There was no need for director since there is no story.Overall: Waste of time and money.,1
Kalank,"WORST MOVIE EVER, VERY BAD MOVIE, NOT ENTERTAIN-ABLE",5
Kalank,Very good movie ..different story then usual love stories nowadays... Excellent performance by all actors. I reccomend everyone to go and watch it then give verdict. well done all cast and crew.!!,5
Kalank,Just watch it you will see this movie is soo good. Bollywood is love. Avoid fake reviews,5
Kalank,Guys it's a beautiful film with outstanding acting larger than life sets brilliant music which makes it a must watch.Don't go after these negative reviews this film is a must watch.It is easily a one time watch.Each shot is beautiful! The film has many twists that just engages u till the end.A brillant effort by Abhishek varman!The climax will surely surprise u.Just keeping the negative reviews aside Do watch it for once.,5
Kalank,It explores eternal love in a beautiful way.It give us a peek into the olden days with simplicity.Everything about the movie is beautiful and well thought.Sitting I didn't want the movie to get over.Alia Bhaathas again won everyone's heart with her character roop.,5
Kalank,Disaster attempts ....capturing history with some cheap tricks and nepokids!!! I guess that's obvious.mentioning here in the comments doesn't change the fact that this guy(KJ)truely support nepotism,1
Kalank,"At its heart Kalank is a story of eternal selfless love that transforms hate and fear. This film made me and my dad cry which is very rare as both of us have only cried a handful of times in our lives. Any film that is able to engage and move you to tears I feel is a worthy film that should be applauded. Although I have given this film 10/10 to boost its ratings on this platform (many have unfairly given it 1/10), I would give this film 4/5 (or 8/10) stars.Summary of the postivives of the film include: the heart felt story, whole-hearted and measured acting, talented acting ensemble, poetic dialogues, breath-taking sets/ costumes and screen play, mesmerising dances and magical songs. In all I felt totally engaged with the film except for maybe 5-10mins.Summary of the negatives of the film: the ending felt unnatural and incomplete, there were a couple of extra uneccerary songs and scenes that stretches the film a bit (probably only 5-10mins), the bull scenes with CGI was really pathetic and looked like a cartoon scene which marred the taperstry of the rest of the film. Although the grand sets and poetic dialogues were completely unrealistic for 1940s pre partition India, the films context is in a magical larger-than-life Dharma set production so I guess you can't really expect it to be realistic.Details of positives:
the biggest strength of the film is the allegorical and metaphorical transformation of Varun Dhanwan's character who is supposed to symbolise the wider sentiment of hatred and fear amongst the Muslim population at the time. The macrocosm of civil unrest and hatred in society is reflected in his microcosm of the hatred he feels for his father for abandoning him as an illegitimate child (perhaps reflecting the feeling muslims may have of Mother/father India abandoning them as illegitimate children). Having never tasted any love In his life he becomes bitter. But he is transformed by the eternally selfless and self-sacrificial love of Alia Bhatt's character. He soon learns to forgive his father and acts in love to eventually sacrifice his own life in protection of his lady love.Some of the acting in this film is stellar and even award worthy at times. Varun's acting depicts him bearing his heart for his love. In some scenes the burning feeling of abandonment and rejection is tangibly palpable. Alia's acting is equally measured, balancing her delicate yet devastating vulnerability with her strength of resolve. Her devastation of losing the love of her live is also devastatingly palpable.Each poetic dialogue feels it's magically woven in a masterpiece of taperstry. Every word is on point.The songs are picture perfect, the subtle pastel and brown hues of the costumes in the songs paint a masterpiece of artwork worthy of a place in an art museum.Details of negatives of the film (note: SPOILER Alert):
The ending of the film I felt does not do justice to the messege of the film of eternal love overcoming all. I feel the whole film was gearing up towards a tragic ending of eternal love where both lovers die together and their souls merge in heaven like a Romeo-Juliet style ending. Even Adithya Roy Kapoor character let's go of Alia's hand leaving her to be with her dying lover. But her supposed eternal love falters in the last moment and she decides not the take the leap out of fear of her life. We are left to console our hearts with the messege that you can still keep your love alive by keeping memories of your love alive. But honestly I think it would better to die for your love rather than live like a dead person in a soul destroying and numbing marriage like a dead person only living in the shadow of the memories of your lost love. Also Alia's character commits another soul shattering betrayal of her love by sleeping with Adithya's character despite her lover coming to her rescue. Perhaps her love is not so eternal after all and unlike her suggestion at the end of the film, she has chosen fear and hatred out of practicality and not love, as the larger than life film suggests. Perhaps, the story is just trying to portray a story based on real life with tragic heroes who cannot live up to their own ideals. However, I feel the larger than life sets of the film does not fit the real life complex character and story it maybe trying to portray.I feel the this film is not for the soft-hearted and can be quite heart wrenching in some scenes. I feel the feint hearted audience who is only looking for a light hearted, superficial, brain numbing, romantic comedy/masala entertainment will not appreciated the depths of emotions evoked in this film. I feel this is a large part of why many people have given this film poor reviews as they have not been able to sit with these difficult emotions for almost 3 hours.I feel much of the audience may not appreciate the subtle nuances of the metaphorical and allegorical message of the film which is played out of the complexity of the character development of Varun Dhanwan. Moreover the last question of the film spoken by Alia, confronts the audience who may feel further disenfrachised from the film if they already did not understand the underlying messege. Instead of humbly accepting that they did not really understand the full purport of the film, it's easier for some viewers to discard it as a 'waste of time' and 'boring' so as to not admit their own lack of underatanding.Furthermore I feel due the the huge expectation of the film, small errors in a couple of extra songs are being blamed for it being lacklustre and too long.I feel some film goers have a hidden agenda as they do not like to see a lot of money being spent on larger than life sets and will want to quash any positive reviews fearing that an already wealthy star cast and production crew may garner more success out of perhaps envy and jealousy.it's true that the set and some dialogues are unrealistic but that is what they should expect in a larger than life Dharma production.Overall apart from a bit jarred ending that leaves a bitter sweet taste in the mouth, this film is near perfect in execution. At its heart the story of eternal love transcending hate and fear is a much needed messege in this day of terrorism and hatred between faiths. To those who have loved and lost, it's a film that tugs at the heart strings and gives hope that love can indeed conquer all. When the power of love overcomes the love of power, hatred and fear only then will there be peace on this Earth. Overall I would give is 4/5 stars (or 8/10). I guess now it's upto you the reader, in reviewing this film, will you choose love or hate?",5
Kalank,"I was sure to watch this movie on first day because of some reasons I couldn't By next day it got hammered so much by our Pseudo intellectual critics, that those who said it not Disappointing everyone started screaming paid reviews . It's sure a really beautiful poetic way of showing epic love story It got hammered for it's rhythmic dailogues a movie with backdrop of love and Muslim culture will not show shayrana andaaz, I guess they never heard of Mirza Galib disappointing is only, for one thing screenplay didn't flow smoothly that's negative Rest storyline aspect of love songs all were done so beautifully except that item number not neededMadhuri Varun Alia Kunal khemu out of world actingoutstanding epic love movie shot with larger than life canvas So beautiful enchanting love story
am glad I didn't miss on big screen and I realized today That's India critics seriously shouldn't not be taken seriously like politician",5
Kalank,"Pros: The scenes were beautiful. The outfits, jewelry, makeup and sets are stunning. The story line is interesting. Actors did a good job and look amazing. Aditya (Dev) has a great screen presence.
Cons: Some scenes are completely unrealistic and poorly done, such as the bull fight. Unrealistic- there is a single girl dressed skimpy dancing amongst all men in the street, where are the other women in town? Or would a dying wife really want to see her husband get married against his will, supposedly when she loves him and he loves her? Stuff like that.",5
Kalank,"A very good movie with great storyline, grand visuals and stunning Alia Bhatt",5
Kalank,"The entire movie is a spoiler. It will spoil your day, your happiness, your faith in bollywood and high budget star cast.",1
Kalank,The movie has nice sets and fabulous music! Surely a one-time watch!!,5
Kalank,"Must watch movie unless u want just entertainment and comedy in movies.
Kalank is the multi-starrer big hit with a huge potential starcast, story line and great dialogues which makes u stick to to movie",5
Kalank,I can't even sit for two hours totally waste of time and money,1
Kalank,"This movie brings nothing new to the table apart from the great sets and costumes. Typical Hindu-Muslim story which I guess everyone is probably sick of now. Can't the writers come with something original or innovative, Movie is very predictable and has very little to offer. What a waste of talent of the star power in this movie.",1
The Tashkent Files,"I watched the movie, I got home, I read some ebooks about the tashkent case. The movie was right. Why was the truth hidden from us? It's a must watch to make people aware of the evils in the society.
The dialogues were the best part of the movie. Acting by Mithun day was awesome. I would appreciate it if the cinematography could have been improved. I hated some awkward camera angles. Otherwise it was a fantastic movie.

The Tashkent Files,"I request all the Indians to watch that movie. Thanks to Vivek Agnihotri for picking that Issue which the government always wanted to hide from us.

The Tashkent Files,Don't go for critics review. It is one of the well made movie. Must watch,5
The Tashkent Files,"Ask anyone from earlier generation and they will collaborate the the story. Some parts may be exaggerated for impact.
There is no denying the fact what transpired was highly questionable. It has not yet erased from collective memory.
The movies uses a hearing committee construct to bring in different views. Some characters are underdeveloped or under utilized. Usage of interview and archive shots make things more believeable.
The transition of protagonist from scoop seeking to truth seeking is a good arch. There are strong performances, each character has strong dialogue based on their view point. Standout being Shweta and Mithun da. I wish Naseer's track was more 3-dimentional.Being conspiracy theory / alternative truth theme the story packs punch, raised uncomfortable questions and expands narrative that public was intentionally miss-informed.It is great to see such an attempt in Indian cinema where in the past mere similarities in script to real life events could get it banned. Take a bow Vivek Agnihorti!!",5
The Tashkent Files,"Oh man! What a movie this was. A real eye opener. How cunningly the facts were hidden from the general public. I was aware of secret agencies (CIA, KGB) role to some extent however, the movie has completely disclosed the motives of the key people behind this conspiracy.
Movie is a must-watch for all Indians and I urge all of you to watch it along with your family as we Indians deserve to know the truth. How US and USSR were playing with us by supporting a certain ""Grand Old Party"" will just shock you. Howeverbe, be aware that this is not your another popcorn flick which you enjoy at weekends. But since the director Vivek Agnihotri has taken such a big risk, we should support him.Go watch this movie and be informed of what was not told to you.",5
The Tashkent Files,"I was looking at several review before going to see this movie but i am amazed.All I can say those reviews are a bit biased against the film.A critic called the movie ""not factual"" , well its not directors fault at all,the movies was inspired by Anuj Dhar book who is a great author. critics may say its ""hysterics into history"" but at least Vivek has the courage to show what ""history"" is.The film is not perfect but it's not bad to be given 1 star review by some critics.",5
The Tashkent Files,"This movie leaves in a thought about how well do we really know about our own country and its history
Our whole life, (at least my generation) we have only been taught about pre independence history and very little about post independence
Cant comment on authenticity but it spark some questions about why no investigations were made for death of then acting Prime Minister of India and that too on Foreign soil especially when he was there to sign treaty with the country whom we were at war with
Fact of our country being people are more interested in masala movies rather then watching factual movies like this
Definitely worth watching movie for people interest in history",5
The Tashkent Files,It's an eye opener how politics in India was ran by main political party. They did what felt good to promote one family and destroyed every other achiever of India like Shastri Jee,5

The whole point of this movie was to seek the truth.The way cast argued on some points really gave goosebumps as to how history can be so easily manipulated.It's a MUST WATCH as these movies don't generally end up in our movie theatres.

The Tashkent Files,"The Tashkent FilesJust out of a special screening of #TheTashkentFiles. Produced by Pallavi Joshi and Vivek Agnihotri, the movie revolves around the mystery surrounding Lal Bahadur Shastri's death. It raises many questions and also provides accounts and documents regarding the mysterious death surrounding the second Prime Minister of India.If you loved Buddha in a Traffic Jam and felt Vivek Agnihotri was brutally honest and polticially incorrect in making that film, he goes one level up with The Tashkent Files and points fingers at even more powerful people and the ideology that drives them.A must watch for the present generation who have never read much on Lal Bahadur Shastri beyond the fact that he was the second Prime Minister of India, this docu drama brings out unpleasant questions of India's tryst with destiny - a destiny which seems to be on a cross roads once again as we head towards #LokSabha2019.And not just this, with Tashkent Files, the makers of the film also expose the magnitude with which the left eco system has systematically infiltrated multiple spheres of our life.I always wondered why could our film makers not come up with a movie revolving around the life and death of Shastri ji.Unfortunately based on his death, this movie does attempt to give us a glimpse of his life and the man that Shastri ji was. I will give it 5/5 to Vivek Agnihotri for having the courage to choose this theme to make a movie on.",5

Dumbo,"Movie starts off good, looks good and Danny Devito is excellent. But again poor casting,poor acting, poor story and extreme amounts of superficial political correctness ruin what could of been a great movie.",1
Dumbo,"This is one of the worst ever Disney's cinema movies. Completely souless this is a forced progressive, naive, PC remake.
It does almost everything wrong, looks like Disney had a really innocent childish pc script and needed something to make it look a little darker, so why not just offer a ton of money to Burton? He does add a little darkness, but is so little that former Dumbo looks like a psychological thriller compared with this one.
I think it is fair to say this is the worst Burton's movie ever, the only good things are Eva Green and Dany De Vito's acting.
Do not waste your time nor your good child memories.",1
Dumbo,"Disney, what is wrong with you??? Who in the Sam Hill is picking your directors, actors, screenwriters, etc? Give them their walking papers so they can go back to their old jobs at Walmart.
Take my advice and stay as far away from this disaster flick as possible. Rent or buy the 1941 original Dumbo.",1
Dumbo,"I grew up obsessed with Dumbo. I was so excited to take my nieces to see this and it was so boring and a huge disappointment. My oldest niece got scared and crawled on top of me a refused to watch it. My husband felt the movie took some political stances. It was overall a very full movie, the acting was subpar, and my poor nieces didn't even enjoy themselves.",1
Dumbo,"Wow, talk about marketing deception, When i first saw the trailers for Dumbo I was wowed, the magic was there on the screen. However when I actually paid for a ticket to see this movie, I felt as though I had walked into another theater and was duped. This movie was a travesty from the get go. The kid actors were the absolute worst, they were SO ANNOYING. All the actors were miscast, you felt disconnected and there was no magic at all. By far one of the worst Disney remakes in history and one of the worst films of the year. AVOID AT ALL COST!",1
Dumbo,"I accept the notion of an elephant flying more than the pretend political correctness of characters set in this time period. It's a condensed version of the original for 45 minutes, then what should have been a sequel. If they had given the original plot the time it needed, they would have made an amazing movie.Why can't we just have a movie about a flying elephant? Why do we need a million unrelated agendas? There's no way to be invested in that many themes, so there's no connection with the characters. He can fly. He wants his mom. That's all you need.",1
Dumbo,"I'll try to keep this simple.
Disney should be ashamed.
Tim Burton should be ashamed.
The screenwriters should be ashamed.
The actors should be ashamed.
Most of all the visual effects supervisor should be ashamed.The visual effects were third rate. I cannot begin to express how awful and unrealistic they are. And this is the 21st century. The story was pointless-muddled as to who the narrative is about. In a cliche summary: this is two hours of my life I will not get back. I hope I will have saved you that.",1
Dumbo,"No stalk, no drunk dumbo. Just a rubbish film. Terrible remake.",1
Dumbo,"Disney owes me money for therapy bills. I left halfway through, and I feel like I forced myself to stay too long.",1
Dumbo,"We went to watch it, the whole family. Me, my wife, my daughter, and my mother in law. I was kinda ready for a not so good movie, but boy did I overestimated this joke!
I almost fell asleep 3 times, my mother in law did, and my wife as well. My daughter played with the rest of the kids in the theater, playing hide and seek and tag.
There was no single person in the full room who enjoyed it. Many people were napping, some were on their phones. The rest were bored to death.
Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. The color palette was typical for Burton, washed down and bleak. The actors played like they had firing line pointed at them. Most of the characters were flat like an ironing board. No character development at all. Dany DeVito was really trying to have this circus going on, but the clowns were suicidal.
The CGI was kinda goodish only during Pink Elephants on parade, the rest was made with pocket money budget.
Unfortunately no feather is able to lift this slob from the ground!1 star is really generous in this case. IMDB should allow negative rating for ""movies"" like this....",1
Dumbo,"Honestly, he was the only good thing about the film. Every single actor forgot they were actors, everything felt so fake and forced, there was no magic. I don't understand why Disney keeps making these remakes. Yes, they have amazing CGI, but they seem to forget the story they're trying to tell. I think this is the worst live-action remake they've done so far.",1
Dumbo,"DumboBurton's live action Disney take on an emotionally driven circus act is profoundly dull. Probably, this has always been the risk that Tim Burton's (the director) sketchy cartoonish world comes with. Even looking at his previous projects, you can easily say that each of the visual galores could have gone wrong. But it is that fine analysation of emotion that Burton personifies on a screen with one dimensional characters; that makes it, against all odds, much better. So when you hear about the collaboration of Burton and Disney, you would think that it is a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, you are going to lose that bet, for carrying out such a wallop of drama, he has decided to surf above it, in fact hover around it, but will not and does not get his hand dirty.There is no string attached to the storytelling, no thread to link them all, ironically in a concept where everyone is rooting for one innocent character. You feel physically distant with this world, not when it tries to brag about its cookiness but when expresses the humane qualities. Although, for a brief period, it does get your feet taping in rhythm, but the credit goes to the ""teamwork"" theme that Disney has been endorsing since ages.The performance is decent coming from Danny DeVito as a goofy manager and Nico Parker as a sweet host of the storyline. And on the other hand, major contenders like Colin Farrell as an over brooding post war hero, Eva Green as the dame and Michael Keaton as a stereotypical evil billionaire fails to make our heart pump fast. Dumbo is not the example to put on a table full of love letters to Disney films, what humanized the animated version in the early 40s, is alienated vigorously by shattering our childhood memories.",0
Dumbo,"This film should be catalogued as animal cruelty for what Tim Burton did to poor Dumbo.This must be the worst Disney film I've ever seen and it's an insult to the surreal vision of love and triumph over overwhelming odds that was the original.
How can it be that the animated version is far more mature and intelligent than the live action one?How can my intelligence feel so insulted by a movie with absolutely no heart and no brain to a point that when I feel compelled to tell people to avoid this like the plague? The movie doesn't make up its mind about what it wants to say or what it wants to be. Is it a critic to Disney buying small (and huge) properties? Does it want to send a ""family"" message? Does it want to say that doesn't matter how you are born (big ears), what you like (science) or what happened to you (losing an arm) it's ok because it's you who matters? No, it doesn't dwell on any of it because god forgive we give the children something to actually think about and have 2 or 3 upset moms feel offended that a movie told their children to be strong in the face of adversity.No, the biggest intelligible lesson from this film is ""when in doubt snort something"" which is a really questionable choice for a film that tries to be as politically correct as possible. I prefer the crows teaching me and Dumbo to believe in yourself even when you lost your mom and and the world seems to be against you.There was a reason why the original was a hit and has become a classic even despite its period derived racism which as a non white I have to say never saw the racism in.Oh yeah, that's another thing, you really wanted to correct the so called ""racism"" from the original? Why not make the family that gets Dumbo through the rough stuff positive black role models?Only positive thing about it? Dumbo looks really cute.This movie is junk food and I don't want my money back. I want my two hours of life back.How dare you sirs? How dare you....",1
Dumbo,"Another crass remake made by Tim Burton, Dumbo fails to deliver hardly anything good to write home about (aside from Danny Devito's performance). It follows the trope-heavy screenplay of ""the kids are always right, adults are wrong"" that just makes you want to sigh constantly. The ""bad"" guys are obvious from the very moment they are introduced and don't actually get revealed as bad until further in the movie, which normally wouldn't be bad in a Disney movie since they are meant to be carried by the musicals and animation, however this doesn't work for Dumbo at all since there are no musical numbers and the villains are revealed in a painstakingly obvious way.
Since this is an adaptation of the 1941 film by Walt, it's fair to draw comparisons despite being very different films. First off is time. Dumbo 1941 was able to tell a very simple story about an elephant that finds out it can fly in an hour and four minutes, and much of this time was taken up by the musical numbers. Those musical numbers are what made the film a classic, not the story. The actual story of Dumbo is simple, it doesn't meander on the fact that the elephant can fly and keep writing story after the elephant flies because it risks losing the wonder and amazement of the spectacle. Dumbo 2019 however takes the approach of introducing the flying elephant very early in the film and follows a poorly written trope-heavy screenplay about the utilization and conflict over the flying elephant. The biggest offenders for myself were Burton's rendition of Pink Elephants, which is only a minor callback in this film and lacks nearly all the iconic elements which made ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" a cinematic spectacle with the original Dumbo. ""Baby Mine"" had a fairly good rendition, not great, but it was one of the better parts. Also included was a reference to the Crows' song, however it was only a joking reference which is like pouring salt on the wounds of a person like myself who wanted to see well done renditions of the classic film. The film is also very dark, with generally hazy skies and dark lighting, the average Tim Burton style. It fits the screenplay but as a whole I despised that stylistic choice with a Disney movie about a flying elephant.
Aside from watching Danny Devito sing Casey Jr. this movie is a skip. I nearly walked out of the theater after Pink Elephants crushed my spirits but hoped for a good musical rendition after the credits rolled (adding onto my disappointment as there was none). Just go watch the original Dumbo, save an extra 50 minutes wasted on a meandering screenplay, and forget that Tim Burton ruined another remake.",1
Dumbo,"This was an embarrassing remake of Dumbo.
First, the hue or color tone of the movie was so unnatural, almost campy, like I had stumbled into a showing of Batman and Robin. It distracted me constantly reminding me that I was at the movies watching actors instead of being part of a story. Secondly, the young female actress did not help that situation at all. She presence was very distracting. Her acting was wooden and unbelievable. She was a carny's kid, living in a circus in 1919 but in every scene, she looked like she had just gotten out of the shower. It was hard to watch.
Finally, who is green lighting these Disney's screenplays? Fire all of them! This movie was called Dumbo but it was about so many other things the elephant and the real story that was told in the original was lost or buried. I was looking forward to these remakes but if they continue to rewrite them I will pass on the rest.",1
Dumbo,"Don't go see this lest you want to be called a dumbo. Totally re-written from the original just to pander to liberal sensibilities which include portraying the little carny girl as a brilliant up and coming dreamer who someday will grow up to be a scientist. Yes, a scientist! Oh brother. And yet her little brother tags along everywhere she goes mindlessly living moment-to-moment with no aspirations whatsoever. Ah how cute, typical toxic male characteristics. Then there is the super-evil corporate giant who wants to own it all, yet at the cost of destroying everything. Enough already with the nonsense. Yes we get it, we all should hate business enterprise and greed because ultimately they will destroy the earth and put us all in chains - at least what's left of us.Except for one Danny DeVito the cast just stumbles through the whole mess. They all look like the overly starched shirts of the times. They deliver their lines as if they're suffering from bad hangovers.Disney really needs to get back on track. They cannot even take a simple sweet story which really tugs at your heartstrings without turning it into a bloated liberal manifesto. Hey, the name Dumbo is already taken, so don't go see this movie.",1
Dumbo,"2019/20 No.1 Razzie award. A total lack of emotions comes through. Aspect ratio deceiving, if you expect sudden brilliance.",1
Dumbo,"This is a lovely film that deserves to be discovered by each generation. Best acting performance of every characters in this film. Everybody should jump aboard experience the circus with DUMBO. No matter how old you are, you just might get something out of it. Not all of it's pretty, but it's always cute and ultimately very funny. I love you DUMBO !!",5
Dumbo,I was so looking forward to this movie. I wanted to love it so much but just couldn't. Really bad job done with this one.,1
Dumbo,"Producers need to quit giving him money. He not only plays it safe (he even waters down the original) , but there's no real energy . Unlike the original, this is no classic.",1
Dumbo,I was so excited about seeing this version but felt pretty depressed straight away as soon as they introduced Dumbos Mum laying on the floor. The only bit I truly loved was seeing Dumbo and Jumbo free in India.,1
Dumbo,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie and came out disappointed.
I've watched the original Dumbo cartoon a lot when I was a child, and remember it to be dark and very sad but with a happy ending.Watching this movie I did not feel that emotion at all. Kind of like to how the children in this movie act. There was no emotional connection between the children and little baby elephant with huge ears. The only look the little girl could do was smile, look pretty and have a fake tear on her cheek.As a circus with (fake) freaks they would have been blessed to have a real baby elephant with those big ears, and the audience would have loved everything about it. I understand the original cartoon they also laugh at Dumbo, but that's because he is very clumsy with those big ears.They way the script has been written to make Dumbo unwanted just does not work. I really miss the mouse Timothy. The children are not a good replacement because of the bad acting.The first 45 minutes of the movie consists of the original story of the cartoon and I expected to see the end credits roll, and that would have been fine.
But then the movie drags on with the story making it over the top and laughable.Like when the woman starts to ride Dumbo looks really silly. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and just started laughing. Michael Keaton is trying to perform a role as bad guy, but he turns out being just stupid when he starts smashing the power station of his circus destroying everything he owns.Also to see Dumbo gets risen up to perform his flying trick for like 4 times in a row got really boring at the end. We've seen him fly multiple times allready!
And why does Dumbo have to snort up this feather like it's his drug or something. In the cartoon he just holds the feather, not snort it.A lot of bad decisions made this movie a big mess. Dumbo looks cute though.",1
Dumbo,"This is a bad movie made with a familiar character from the past shoehorned into it to try to get people to watch it. It isn't Dumbo, it's a completely different movie and it's cliched and boring.",1
Dumbo,"They really managed to overcomplicate a sweet and simple storyline, causing the original message to get lost in an entirely different story, the same story which Hollywood has been shoving down our throats repeatedly the last ten or so years. It's getting old. This 'new' message of 'large corporations bad/underdogs good', followed the clich that all successful businessmen are greedy, heartless, power-hungry monsters who'll do anything to get what they want. An overplayed roll at the best of times. Surprisingly the main character was no longer Dumbo, but a little girl, who fit the cookie cutter Hollywood standard: Little girl who overcomes the patriarchy, (represented in this instance by her father), to live her dream of being a scientist. Again, the same story we've had shoved down our throats in countless other movies has now taken over one of Disney's most classic stories of self-discovery. It was entirely disappointing. You see, at the theaters we have a unique opportunity to escape politics and everyday life to live in a world of fantasy for whatever brief period we've been allotted to go there. Disney believed that if you're only catering to children then you've already failed at entertaining. I'd like to add upon that by saying that if you only aim to tell the same story repeatedly, injecting it in to previous stories that were perfect good without it, then you've failed at story telling. Somewhere along the line Hollywood only managed to remember a single story in the vast empire of stories it's accumulated throughout the years, and that story is what was represented here. Not Dumbo, the story which Disney brought to life and inspired millions with over generations. But the same story you've seen in a hundred movies over the past few years. Why bother going to watch it at all? You already know the story, and it isn't Dumbo...
Okay that was harsh. Positive sides of this monstrosity now...The acting was good, despite the butchered storyline. The actors did an amazing job...AND special effects were pretty cool as well, so good on the special effect's artists, that could not have been easy...As that's 2 positive traits I was able to find, I think it's fair I give the movie at least 2 stars.",1
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,It's definitely not as good as conjuring or annabelle. My expectations aren't too high just based on the reviews we're seen but overall it really wasn't bad. There were several scenes really did create the atmosphere. In the end it's another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story !!,3
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,At first i dont know if this movie from conjuring universe until Annabell doll show up. I think this movie good.,4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,GoodMovie. Scary too!! Climax is somewhat happy ending!! Liked it.,4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I really enjoyed the movie. I dont know why movie is getting a bit negative remarks as horror movies are which are tough to make and honestly, movie do get my respect atleast.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I went here with my parents, they really liked it, it was very entertaining for us, very nice sfx, funny moments, the kids acting is amazing, the story is very well said, maybe its only problem was being linked to the conjuring universe, because everyone relates it to the nun, but this is way better than the nun which was veeeery boring, this had very nice shots with lots of tension.",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"This was a film that I first heard about at the Nightmare Film Festival. I've enjoyed most of The Conjuring universe to this point and was interested to see how this film played out. The synopsis is ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother suspected of child endangerment, a social worker and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm.We kick this one off in Mexico back in 1671. We see a mother, Marisol Ramirez, with her two sons. They are playing a game and one of them closes their eyes. Once he opens them, his brother and mother are gone. He finds them in a local creek, with his mother drowning his brother. He is then next.It then shifts to 1971 in Los Angeles. We see a single mother, Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardellini), as she is trying to get her children ready for school. Her son is Chris (Roman Christou) and daughter Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). Their father was a police officer and was killed in the line of duty, so they are struggling to get by without him. The kids miss the school bus and she has to drive them. Anna is a social worker and she is typing up reports. Her boss tells her co-worker to take over one of her cases for a Hispanic woman. Anna fights with him to let her go, as the woman is suspicious and won't speak with the other woman.Anna and a police officer go to the apartment. It belongs to Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez). Her sons have been missing school. They are found locked in a closet. They are taken into protective custody and Patricia is arrested.That night things take a turn. Anna is woken up by a phone call. She goes to a river where both of the boys were drowned. We saw an entity, La Llorona, took them from the facility, but the mother is suspected. Anna has to bring her kids to the crime scene and tells Chris to stay in the car. He doesn't listen and encounters the entity as well.The family is then haunted by this spirit and it starts to break their already shaky lifestyle. It gets to the point where Anna's work makes a visit, thinking she is abusing her children. She has to find help from her local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola). He believes her as he encountered the entity possessing the Annabelle doll. He tells her it will take time for the church to get involved and directs her to a former priest who does more folk healing, Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz).Now I want to lead off stating, what I was really interested in this film was the lore of La Llorona. I didn't know much about the history of this, but I'm always up to learn more about an entity I don't know much about. This one is interesting as when I heard about this film coming out that there are many films about this spirit. From posts on my social media, it seems that this film takes some liberties with it and that it has changed quite a bit. I think I might search out some of these films to see what is different and look more into this legend.This film has an interesting concept in the job that Anna has. She is a social worker that deals with children that are in houses that could be high risk. I like the idea that the ghost is making those at her work question if she is abusing her own children. Being that she is a single mother, it could be that things have gotten to be too much. There is also an aspect of racism here. Anna was married to a man of Hispanic descent. She states she has built a rapport with them and the other worker is of Asian descent. I found this intriguing though, because Anna is Caucasian. She claims it is because she is a mother and not the ethic background. During this time period of enlightenment, it is good that it was pointed out.I found this film to keep my attention throughout. It doesn't waste any time getting into the haunting and I feel that the film continues to build tension. The stakes continue to heighten as the spirit becomes stronger and stronger. It is actually an interesting curse that those that come in contact with it then have to deal. The climax of the film was pretty solid and Rafael is pretty funny in some of the things he says. Also the ending was pretty fitting for what the film was building toward as well.The acting was also pretty solid as well. Cardellini is an actress that I grew up watching on the television show ER. I thought her as a mother in this film was good and it was a good choice to show her as she is trying to keep her family together with the death of her husband. She is also still quite attractive. I thought both Christou and Kinchen did a solid job. Children are really hit or miss for me; with these two I would say definitely the former. Cruz was good in this film as was Velasquez. I also liked Sean Patrick Thomas who was a detective who knew Anna's husband and Amendola was solid as the priest as well. I couldn't finish this section, without talking about Ramirez and her performance. I think she did a fine job and she had good look as the entity. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.The effects I was pleasantly surprised with how well they were done. There was quite a bit of CGI, but it looked pretty solid. They enhanced La Llorona with them and some of the things that she did. This film did rely a lot on jump-scares, which I'm not the biggest fan of. I do think they were some pretty effective ones in this. It was also shot very well. I was a big fan of the mirrors that were used to show some things. It is a motif it goes back to a few times. Not knowing the back-story might hurt me here, but she looks into them quite a bit and they crack. This is something I'll definitely look into and update accordingly.Now with that said, this film I thought was pretty solid. It is about an entity I don't know much about and I think I will definitely look into, as it is an interesting concept. I have heard there were some liberties taken, which I'm actually interested in learning more about as well. It really needed to mesh into The Conjuring universe which is also part of it and I think it did well there. I thought the acting was good and the editing of the film was well. The effects were CGI heavy, but I didn't have any issues there. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt the film. I do think this is one of the better films in this universe and I found it to be above average overall. It is really a ghostly, but I don't think it is cheesy like many in this genre.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,I liked it very much. I didn't get very scared but I enjoyed it a lot.,5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,Great story and very creepy. Love James Wan movies!,5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"The Haters and bad Reviewers always have issues with understanding any film. Do not believe what they say they are lying through their teeth with their stupid reviews.This film was unspeakably terrifying, I dont get scared easily but this one will terrify you from start to finish. It is haunting, dark.Masterpiece in the making a great cast, phenomenal directing and absolutely magnificent performances by all cast.A truly edge of your seat Horror that will leave you breathless. She is so terrifying and she is coming for you. An outstanding 10/10",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"It is one of the same group of conjuring movies. Not a silly one but kind of scary and entertaining at the same time, do not listen to the bad reviews, got all of what you need to be on the edge of your seat.
definitely Recommend.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I really enjoyed this movie. I think the way to go is Dolby Digital because the immersive sound really adds to the scares and sounds of La Llarona and keeps your attention. What I love most about this movie, is that La Llarona is very visible throughout the movie. You actually see the spirit for good amounts of time and not just intended for a cheap jump scares. I also love that the mother quickly sees the spirit and right away believes in this and doesn't think her kids are just crazy and seeing things. The cinematography was beautiful as well. Now, they're are things I didn't like. Things that were just illogical and predictable. I know that little girl was way smarter than to open the door to reach for her doll while a spirit she knows wants to get her. I also didn't like how at first, when the mother saw the burns on the girls wrist, it was quickly dismissed and to really be believed as just a bad fall. Last but not least, why didn't the kids just say what they saw at first. How could anyone keep that a secret. Overall, good horror movie that exceeded my expectations, especially considering the horrible Nun movie. I'm gonna say this is 3rd best behind conjuring 1 and 2.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"Good Scare , good acting and good photography for a horror movie !",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,It was a very good movie. Suspenseful from beginning to end. A lot of scenes that made me jump. Great cast. Enjoyed it very much!,5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"It has his moments. Perhaps, Story could have been better and a little better ending? Anyway, it is a nice one time watch movie with lots of thrilling & horror moments.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"It was a good jump scare movie. I think my grandmother's stories were a lot scarier than the overall explanation of her back story. The best part of this is the Conjuring connection. It had some brief comedy relief, and some serious tones through out. Not bad for a mexican folklore movie.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"For a low budget, low profile film , this film scared the bejesus out of me , the editing when the baddie comes is excellent",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,Love it. After so many years i saw a pure horror movie. First show ever to see movie in theatre,4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I almost didn't see this based on all the negativity in the user reviews- I don't bother reading critic reviews anymore. I really think there is too much over-criticism for this movie... I was entertained, and think most like me that don't watch very many horror/fright flicks would have fun watching this one. Yes, this has been done many times before; yes, lots of jump scares; yes, not fully fleshed out storyline and light on character development... but the acting was VERY good and the music setting the mood was effective. I saw this in IMAX, so the surprise loud scares were enhanced, and the dark scenes were probably better. Hey... grab your SO and go see this one just for the fun of it.",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"A create of Conjuring filmaker, but the curse still adapted equal with horror type even unexpected scene makes the film",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,I watch horror all the time it's never scary to me just entertaining.... I saw this in imax... To me it was amazing.,5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"I'm not going to offer spoilers, and I highly recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre.The acting is spot on, which is especially noteworthy. Two of the main cast members are very talented children. You believe they're terrified.The story, of course, is based on the Mexican legend, and the writers and director did a great job of creating a modern tale, based on the legend. This is a big accomplishment. Many times, a tale based on legend does not play well on the big screen. This one stands out, and I feel confident in saying it will be a Halloween favorite for generations to come.The characters in peril are all more than likeable. They're either lovable, solicit your empathy, or have a perfect horror film presence.Ir al cine. La Llorona te espera!",4
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"After a long time James Wan has done a great job on this movie,it's a must watch for horror movie fans.",5
The Curse Of The Weeping Woman,"The backstory was laid perfectly nice and the connections to the conjuring series made some nice twist.. as a fan of the franchise and horror films, this was a good movie with enough scare and suspense to keep up the interest..
Loved it..",4
Oru Yamandan Prema Kadha,A movie without any good story line. Some suppose to be comedy scenes stitched together to a totally un-realistic wafer thin story. Stunt scenes are prolonged like Tamil movies. On the whole waste of time and money.,2
Oru Yamandan Prema Kadha,"The first half was perfect with cracking joking.Thought this was going to be an another kattappana.Dulquer,Vishnu,Salim kumar,Soubin was doing their best and their shows made everyone in the theatres laughing out.But actually what was the makers thinking about second half?A movie which had all the potential to become a colorful comedy entertainer changes it's direction and becomes unrealistic and suddenly rubber fights comes to the screen.As a genuine fan of dulquer,I don't want him to go to the path of mohanlal/mamooty who is doing pathetic films due to their fans.",3

Tried to introduce a lot of new terms and get itself to be named a cult classic but failed miserably. How on earth did they get the guy who did ustad hotel and npcb to act in this movie.. ill never know.. i wanted to give it a zero rating but there was no option for that.

Oru Yamandan Prema Kadha,"Oru yamandan premakadha hidden gems reviewA very thought provoking humorous movie. Some hidden gems that really touched me which you may have missed:a) if you see something wrong and you have the power to stop it , you should. Similar to how Spider-Man did not stop the robber which later killed his uncle, here dulqar could have stopped the villain.
b) some things which you consider as not important may be something that may be so very imp to you at some point in life. Like the whistle that dulqar gave. Never ignore people based on their status, you never know who will be there when you have a need
c) every one has a purpose in this world no matter what. Like dharmajan and his friend seeing the accident. That helped solved the puzzle and avoided many more dangers the villain may have caused to others
d) life need not be so complicated. People run behind money and stress but life can be so simple like when dulqar drinks the tea when it rains, the smile you get or the happiness he got during the butcher's wedding rather than some formal wedding which are all fake smiles
e) Being a good parent means not forcing children to become like them and give them the freedom. Like Ranji Pan being a lawyer and power could have forced dulqar to be educated and made him do some job which he didn't like. He didn't do that.
f) being blind still he doesn't give up and lives the world. It's symbolic to many things which we may not have but other have. But don't give up
g) Also when you say you will do it, do it if you can even if it is as simple as like pray to god for them like she said to the kid.
h) finally there are unknown connections on this world which you can't explain like connection with Lena and also the cross that comes to dulqar at end which she gave to that kid.",5
Oru Yamandan Prema Kadha,Comedy and family entertainment . After a long time seeing good movie.,5
Oru Yamandan Prema Kadha,"I like this movie very much. Its an excellent movie. When we looking the comedy and the story, we can say that it is a amaizing movie. Actors like dulqar salamn, suraj, vishnu, bibin, saleem kumar, baiju, ext.. are excellent and they are natural acting to their character
It is superb movie...

How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic. I would strongly suggest watching the first two installments before watching this film.Signing offSilly D",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I promise not to spoil the film below.
This film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film. This movie is amazing, now go watch it!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"You need to watch this movie 20 times! It's the epic conclusion of one of the greatest stories ever! You will cry at the end for sure! I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, it took some time to connect with the audience. But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!! Best Dreamworks movie, and one of the best animations I've seen!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Walking into this film I had very high expectations.The first movie, I'd watched when I was about 8 years old and I fell in love with the characters and the world behind Vikings and dragons. It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried. I've taken my kids to all 3 movies, and we've loved all of them. I must admit, I was nervous going in after watching the diabolical Wreck it Ralph 2. Was this 2nd sequel going to finish on a high?
Absolutely, it didn't let me down. It had heart, it had a great story and an epic finish.
Dreamworks, you've out done pixar on this one, well done!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I went and saw this movie with my best friend and her two brothers today and I cannot stop thinking about it. It was the best way to end the franchise of my favourite movies since I was eight years old. I'm 17 now, and I still love it as much as I did then. It covers pretty much everything I hoped would happen.
A lot of this movie was focused mainly on Toothless instead of Hiccup and he makes a lot of the decisions in this movie that Hiccup might have made in the first two films. He is also being drawn away from Hiccup after meeting the Light Fury and Hiccup starts to discover who he is without his dragon and also focus on his relationship with Astrid. Both dragon and human make impossible decisions to save their kind.
This movie is very emotional and gives a different vibe to the first two films and includes everything a true HTTYD would want to see. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially in the scenes were Toothless and the Light Fury are falling in love. The soundtrack is also beautiful and fits in well with the scene. There is also good character development, especially for Hiccup and Toothless, of course, and we even see a little more of a significant role in a coupe of the characters we've always known to be comedic relief.
I was very happy with the final film in my favourite movie franchise, and I even cried a little bit in the last ten minutes. It is more dark and mature than the first two films and can therefore be loved by adults as well. Thank you so much, How to Train your Dragon franchise. You changed my life for the better.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This film is well executed , good movie but not impressed . Don't put high expectations on this film . A charming movie , not to be taken too seriously but ultimately very entertaining and sad . You really do need to learn how to train your dragon !!",3
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"With the first two full length features in the franchise being some of my favourite animated movies out there, I had high expectations going in; i was not disappointed at all. The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way.
With the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story.
The animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010.
It contains numerous homages to the first film that will make all viewers laugh and cry alike.
Overall, a very pleasing and emotionally affecting end to the saga with a strong emotional message about friendship",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This is the most beautiful and amazing movie of all time!!! Even I can say that this movie is better than its previous ones, and it's much to say. I've never cried so much with a movie... It can't be better ending for this trilogy. These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are. So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I went in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World with high expectations. I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love
the score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10",4
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.
Now the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"I love this movie as much as I loved The first two
The soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)
The animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)
The friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much
Toothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together
Hiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side
I'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes
I love ruffnut she is so funny
And the ending is beautiful it is so perfect
What an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy
Thank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,The animation is amazing. The story is unique. A less obvious conclusion and the best characters ever. Definately recommended.Even adults will be laughing throughout the entire thing.,5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn't fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn't they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.
Animation - 8/10
Visuals - 8/10
Action - 7/10
Humour - 6/10
Storyline - 6/10",4
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,How to train your dragon is amazing and the hidden world is even more so. Can't wait till I can buy it on DVD and watch it a million times.,5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"No spoilers hereWhat I can say is this the trailers don't do the movie justice. It's sad to see this awesome and wonderful journey come to a conclusion but it is the right time, It's both got heart and love yes most movies have love but this was more then just love. Don't let others decide the movie for you go watch it and see the amazing world of dragons and the hidden world you will not be disappointedMy review is this 1000/1000",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Some of these 10 star reviews must be fake. I LOVED the other movies in this series, but this one was pretty boring.It wasn't horrible, but I felt so indifferent to the characters and the plot whereas the first few I felt really invested.It felt much more ""kiddish"" and less character depth.",3
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in the trilogy, which in every way is the best of the 3, While taking a different tone the film itself feels more grown up along with its characters, this time around having a much more fleshed out world that seems lived in and real while also being an amazing character piece that deals with many heavier issues than is displayed in the trailers released, which should not be watched by ANYONE who doesn't want to know what happens before they see it. With a more thought out and thorough script and an amazing jump in visuals and story telling How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a staple in animation while being a heartwarming and tear jerking send off to our beloved characters.",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"What a gorgeous movie! They just got it right. Everyone needs a friendship like that in life and we all need a reminder of love is loss.
A heartwarming story and hilarious scenes. Heros and kings are men and men a just dumber than women, the girls always save the day!!!!
And boys, the best way to impress a lady is not to dance (please!) just be yourself, do what you love most - or just draw your silly face like Toothless. She will like that!
The attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!
Also Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader. The leader of the pack like in wolves always the last one to watch out for the rest.
The only thing is that Toothless love story took most screentime so not much was said about the villain but, do we complain? Absolutely not!
Fly on your own Hiccup!",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This movie is amazing, so much heart as been thrown in, emotional scenes and great visuals. I really hope I'd get to see it again. Officially my favourite movie",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"Dreamworks has done it agin. I can't explain enough how brilliant the movie was, it's perfect, and that's definitely an understatement",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.",2
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"This is literally dreamworks's masterpiece, no need to explain further...",5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,A good ending for this trilogy. I got so emotional on ending.,5
How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"First of all, let me start by pointing out the following: the fact that the ending of a movie moves you to tears, doesn't make it WOW THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
I am a huge fan of the franchise but this movie was a huge let-down. I agree with the criticism I've already read on this page. Story underdeveloped, the villain extremely underwhelming... The whole movie is basically shown in the trailer. Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really. Very dissappointing.",3
Diksoochi,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic. I would strongly suggest watching the first two installments before watching this film.Signing offSilly D",5
Diksoochi,"I promise not to spoil the film below.
This film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film. This movie is amazing, now go watch it!",5
Diksoochi,"You need to watch this movie 20 times! It's the epic conclusion of one of the greatest stories ever! You will cry at the end for sure! I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, it took some time to connect with the audience. But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!! Best Dreamworks movie, and one of the best animations I've seen!",5
Diksoochi,"Walking into this film I had very high expectations.The first movie, I'd watched when I was about 8 years old and I fell in love with the characters and the world behind Vikings and dragons. It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even",5
Diksoochi,"Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried. I've taken my kids to all 3 movies, and we've loved all of them. I must admit, I was nervous going in after watching the diabolical Wreck it Ralph 2. Was this 2nd sequel going to finish on a high?
Absolutely, it didn't let me down. It had heart, it had a great story and an epic finish.
Dreamworks, you've out done pixar on this one, well done!",5
Diksoochi,"I went and saw this movie with my best friend and her two brothers today and I cannot stop thinking about it. It was the best way to end the franchise of my favourite movies since I was eight years old. I'm 17 now, and I still love it as much as I did then. It covers pretty much everything I hoped would happen.
A lot of this movie was focused mainly on Toothless instead of Hiccup and he makes a lot of the decisions in this movie that Hiccup might have made in the first two films. He is also being drawn away from Hiccup after meeting the Light Fury and Hiccup starts to discover who he is without his dragon and also focus on his relationship with Astrid. Both dragon and human make impossible decisions to save their kind.
This movie is very emotional and gives a different vibe to the first two films and includes everything a true HTTYD would want to see. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially in the scenes were Toothless and the Light Fury are falling in love. The soundtrack is also beautiful and fits in well with the scene. There is also good character development, especially for Hiccup and Toothless, of course, and we even see a little more of a significant role in a coupe of the characters we've always known to be comedic relief.
I was very happy with the final film in my favourite movie franchise, and I even cried a little bit in the last ten minutes. It is more dark and mature than the first two films and can therefore be loved by adults as well. Thank you so much, How to Train your Dragon franchise. You changed my life for the better.",5
Diksoochi,"This film is well executed , good movie but not impressed . Don't put high expectations on this film . A charming movie , not to be taken too seriously but ultimately very entertaining and sad . You really do need to learn how to train your dragon !!",3
Diksoochi,"With the first two full length features in the franchise being some of my favourite animated movies out there, I had high expectations going in; i was not disappointed at all. The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way.
With the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story.
The animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010.
It contains numerous homages to the first film that will make all viewers laugh and cry alike.
Overall, a very pleasing and emotionally affecting end to the saga with a strong emotional message about friendship",5
Diksoochi,"This is the most beautiful and amazing movie of all time!!! Even I can say that this movie is better than its previous ones, and it's much to say. I've never cried so much with a movie... It can't be better ending for this trilogy. These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are. So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.",5
Diksoochi,"I went in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World with high expectations. I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love
the score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10",4
Diksoochi,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.
Now the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.",5
Diksoochi,"I love this movie as much as I loved The first two
The soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)
The animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)
The friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much
Toothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together
Hiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side
I'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes
I love ruffnut she is so funny
And the ending is beautiful it is so perfect
What an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy
Thank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series",5
Diksoochi,The animation is amazing. The story is unique. A less obvious conclusion and the best characters ever. Definately recommended.Even adults will be laughing throughout the entire thing.,5
Diksoochi,"The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn't fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn't they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.
Animation - 8/10
Visuals - 8/10
Action - 7/10
Humour - 6/10
Storyline - 6/10",4
Diksoochi,How to train your dragon is amazing and the hidden world is even more so. Can't wait till I can buy it on DVD and watch it a million times.,5
Diksoochi,"No spoilers hereWhat I can say is this the trailers don't do the movie justice. It's sad to see this awesome and wonderful journey come to a conclusion but it is the right time, It's both got heart and love yes most movies have love but this was more then just love. Don't let others decide the movie for you go watch it and see the amazing world of dragons and the hidden world you will not be disappointedMy review is this 1000/1000",5
Diksoochi,"Some of these 10 star reviews must be fake. I LOVED the other movies in this series, but this one was pretty boring.It wasn't horrible, but I felt so indifferent to the characters and the plot whereas the first few I felt really invested.It felt much more ""kiddish"" and less character depth.",3
Diksoochi,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in the trilogy, which in every way is the best of the 3, While taking a different tone the film itself feels more grown up along with its characters, this time around having a much more fleshed out world that seems lived in and real while also being an amazing character piece that deals with many heavier issues than is displayed in the trailers released, which should not be watched by ANYONE who doesn't want to know what happens before they see it. With a more thought out and thorough script and an amazing jump in visuals and story telling How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a staple in animation while being a heartwarming and tear jerking send off to our beloved characters.",5
Diksoochi,"What a gorgeous movie! They just got it right. Everyone needs a friendship like that in life and we all need a reminder of love is loss.
A heartwarming story and hilarious scenes. Heros and kings are men and men a just dumber than women, the girls always save the day!!!!
And boys, the best way to impress a lady is not to dance (please!) just be yourself, do what you love most - or just draw your silly face like Toothless. She will like that!
The attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!
Also Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader. The leader of the pack like in wolves always the last one to watch out for the rest.
The only thing is that Toothless love story took most screentime so not much was said about the villain but, do we complain? Absolutely not!
Fly on your own Hiccup!",5

Diksoochi,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World).

Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"This is the most beautiful and amazing movie of all time!!! Even I can say that this movie is better than its previous ones, and it's much to say. I've never cried so much with a movie... It can't be better ending for this trilogy. These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are. So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"I went in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World with high expectations. I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love
the score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10",4
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.
Now the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"I love this movie as much as I loved The first two
The soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)
The animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)
The friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much
Toothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together
Hiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side
I'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes
I love ruffnut she is so funny
And the ending is beautiful it is so perfect
What an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy
Thank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,The animation is amazing. The story is unique. A less obvious conclusion and the best characters ever. Definately recommended.Even adults will be laughing throughout the entire thing.,5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn't fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn't they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.
Animation - 8/10
Visuals - 8/10
Action - 7/10
Humour - 6/10
Storyline - 6/10",4
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,How to train your dragon is amazing and the hidden world is even more so. Can't wait till I can buy it on DVD and watch it a million times.,5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"No spoilers hereWhat I can say is this the trailers don't do the movie justice. It's sad to see this awesome and wonderful journey come to a conclusion but it is the right time, It's both got heart and love yes most movies have love but this was more then just love. Don't let others decide the movie for you go watch it and see the amazing world of dragons and the hidden world you will not be disappointedMy review is this 1000/1000",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"Some of these 10 star reviews must be fake. I LOVED the other movies in this series, but this one was pretty boring.It wasn't horrible, but I felt so indifferent to the characters and the plot whereas the first few I felt really invested.It felt much more ""kiddish"" and less character depth.",3
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in the trilogy, which in every way is the best of the 3, While taking a different tone the film itself feels more grown up along with its characters, this time around having a much more fleshed out world that seems lived in and real while also being an amazing character piece that deals with many heavier issues than is displayed in the trailers released, which should not be watched by ANYONE who doesn't want to know what happens before they see it. With a more thought out and thorough script and an amazing jump in visuals and story telling How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a staple in animation while being a heartwarming and tear jerking send off to our beloved characters.",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"What a gorgeous movie! They just got it right. Everyone needs a friendship like that in life and we all need a reminder of love is loss.
A heartwarming story and hilarious scenes. Heros and kings are men and men a just dumber than women, the girls always save the day!!!!
And boys, the best way to impress a lady is not to dance (please!) just be yourself, do what you love most - or just draw your silly face like Toothless. She will like that!
The attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!
Also Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader. The leader of the pack like in wolves always the last one to watch out for the rest.
The only thing is that Toothless love story took most screentime so not much was said about the villain but, do we complain? Absolutely not!
Fly on your own Hiccup!",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"This movie is amazing, so much heart as been thrown in, emotional scenes and great visuals. I really hope I'd get to see it again. Officially my favourite movie",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"Dreamworks has done it agin. I can't explain enough how brilliant the movie was, it's perfect, and that's definitely an understatement",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.",2
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"This is literally dreamworks's masterpiece, no need to explain further...",5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,A good ending for this trilogy. I got so emotional on ending.,5
Idhi ChalaThakkuva,"First of all, let me start by pointing out the following: the fact that the ending of a movie moves you to tears, doesn't make it WOW THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
I am a huge fan of the franchise but this movie was a huge let-down. I agree with the criticism I've already read on this page. Story underdeveloped, the villain extremely underwhelming... The whole movie is basically shown in the trailer. Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really. Very dissappointing.",3
Uyare,"Uyare is something that Mollywood has never tried. This is a movie which revolves around a victim (I'm not spoiling by saying what victim) and her struggles to thrive. Uyare has its low points particularly in the making. The movie clearly makes us understand that it is a low budgeted movie but they had done an extraordinary work in such a low budget. I'm not a big fan of Parvathy but she has done an extraordinary job and gave one of the best performance by a leading female actress in a long time. Asif Ali was also good in a negative role and Tovino was a sight to cherish. Overall, Uyare is a must watch Malayalam movie for its performance and excellent story.",4
Uyare,"Atleast got oxygen after watching too much mass-masala's from mollywood.Such films should be promoted and accepted.Warmth story of survival.
Parvathy is excellent.Only a personality as her could do such an excellent role.Asif ali on other hand,did his best.Everyone will hate him after the watch which is the win of that character.On an sexist society,where female actors get attacked by superstar's goons Uyare is a must watch movie which may change the perspectives of some.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"Best animal movie of the year. Best acting performance to all the characters in this movie !! Character BELLA a.k.a Shelby was absolutely amazing !! For director Charles Martin Smith, you has created a good film this year !! For all of you, go see it you wont regret it !! I love this movie so much !!",5
A Dog's Way Home,"Can't believe there would be a negative review on this. Took my 3 year old and she enjoyed the whole thing, as did I. Reviews with any mentioned politics are very closed minded reviewers. This has a well delivered heart warming adventure. Enjoy",5
A Dog's Way Home,I knew what it was going into it and it did not disappoint. I'll take animals over most people any day. I never saw any of the things these other reviews point out. I was entertained. I cried. I laughed. I went home and hugged my two American Staffordshire Terriers very tight. Thank you for this movie.,5
A Dog's Way Home,This movie was one of the best animal movies I have seen. The twists and turns were so real and raw. The acting was great! Bella Aka Shelby was absolutely amazing!!,5
A Dog's Way Home,"Fun movie, good story, people over thinking it. Great for family (the lack of family movies this is filling a good spot). I took my younger half-sister, she enjoyed herself, I heard both adults and kids laughing, yes there's some serious scenes but it's also that lesson in life about bullies and how people overcome them. There's a single ""PC"" scene but it didn't bother an ultra-conservative like me because it was done well imo. Good movie, good message. Look at it for what it is, a feel good movie with a great happy ending.",5
A Dog's Way Home,A heartwarming tale of a loving dog who is a victim of breed discrimination doesnt understamd that her owner must send her away to protect her and her mission was to find him again. I laughed i cried and i feel in love with a dog named bella and the friends she made along the way.,5
A Dog's Way Home,"I believe there are far too many cynics and naysayers in the movie theatres. This was a lovely story, especially if you love dogs, cats, wildlife and human beings. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the characters, portraying our returning Veterans' plight in today's society, and lifestyles of the dog's advocates. Love is love, period. People who felt there was a political agenda are seriously clueless. Get agrip, people.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"I just saw A Dog's Way Home. The movie great and made me cry. Everything was wonderful in the movie but having read the book I noticed many things changed or missing from the movie that was in the book. There was no mention of Sylvia, the near drowning incident, Chloe and her cats , Gavin and Taylor's trip to China or Axel's real cause of death. Just thought I'd point these out though still the movie was great. I even loved the breath-taking scenery.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"It was a nice feel good movie.
If you like animals and nature you will like this movie.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"It's really good, loved the nuances and the story.",5
A Dog's Way Home,My children and I enjoy this fim very much. The life from the dog's view is very interesting.,5
A Dog's Way Home,This movie was a great family movie and recommend it to anyone who loves there animals as much as we do.,5
A Dog's Way Home,Nice to have arena movie that lifts the spirits instead of some of the junk out there,5
A Dog's Way Home,"I'm unsure as to why people are rating this movie poorly. You knew exactly what it was prior to purchasing your ticket. Oh you didn't enjoy seeing the same sex relationship in the film? Sorry your a homophobe but with equal rights thriving and it being 2019... grow up. This is a feel good movie that tells a wonderful story. Why make it more than what it is? Why decide to be negative? Like Bella said you are all the type ""who deserve to be alone"".",5
A Dog's Way Home,"I, myself thoroughly enjoyed this movie! But then, I read the book before I saw the movie! Who cares if there was a gay couple. They weren't blatant about it! And they were already in the story before he and his wife, Cathryn wrote the screenplay! The whole purpose of the movie, ( this is A Dogs Way Homes purpose, pun intended. ) is to highlight that Denver Colorado has some arcane laws in regards to BREED discrimination! Just because an animal control officer, veterinarian or who ever calls a dog a ""pit bull"" , then it is thereby deemed a pit bull and therefore is not allowed to live in Denver, Colorado! I learned about this some years ago from Shorty Rossi. People literally have to HIDE their beloved pets! Or they will be confiscated and possibly euthanized! NOT OK! Anyway, if you had read the book before seeing the movie, you would already know this! This movie is true to the book, except for I kept waiting for the scene when Bella rescues the kittens in the pool, but sadly, that wasn't written into the screenplay. But I forgive you, Cathryn and Bruce! I know you cant put everything in! Lol. I saw this movie with my whole family and we all loved it! Bring Kleenex! Shelby, aka, Bella was great!",5
A Dog's Way Home,"I just went and saw this little gem of a movie over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everyone else in the theater with me seemed to be enjoying it as well - We all laughed and cried at just the right moments. I glanced down through some of the reviews and, sure enough, there were the inevitable ""thumbs-down"" reviews, which, unfortunately, doesn't surprise me. My theory on why there are always going to be ""those people"" who will find the negative in literally anything is that there are two kinds of people in the world: The glass half-empty type and the glass half-full type. I guess I'm in the later type as I usually always look for the positive - Of course, there is also the direct opposite of that kind of person and that is the person who always looks for the negative. So, if you aren't sure if you want to see this wonderful movie or not, just ask yourself what type of person are you? You will then have your answer. By the way, I can't end this review without mentioning the very special little dog who was the star of this movie - Bella, whose real name is ""Shelby"" - A rescue who was found in deplorable conditions in Tennessee. It's my understanding that the author, W. Bruce Cameron, was determined to use a rescue and a little diamond was found and saved, which made this movie all the more special.",5
A Dog's Way Home,There are plenty of Movies to come for the remainder of 2019. but this one currently holds the title of movie of the year I loved it!,5
A Dog's Way Home,"First and foremost I will say that ""A Dog's Way Home"" is a beautiful movie! However, if you are thinking about taking your young one to see it I would suggest viewing it at home first rather than in a theater. There are some scenes in it that are pretty dark, lead your young one to ask questions that you want to answer, but you're in a theater where you're supposed to be quiet making for an awkward situation.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"First recommendation for potential viewers: be an animal lover. Secondly, go in with an open mind with regards to interactions between humans (of all kinds) and the animal kingdom. While the film called to my mind movies such as THe Incredible Journey (1963) or Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993), the biggest difference was the fact that the focus was on one dog making a long trek back to its human. At least it was heartwarming to me.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"To all the naysayers, this is not ""A Dog's Way Home"". This is about one dog's life, not several and it is cute, funny and so heartwarming! There are so many instances where the dog is in danger or is lured to stay with others who want her, but she wants her Lucas, so she continues her trek home.There is some CGI, but it was done well. There were many tears for me, but not sad tears. These are the tears that come from that sudden swelling of your heart that is so intense that it feels like it overflowed and pushed the tears right out of your eyes!If you don't like excitement, fun and tears of joy, then definitely do not see this film.
However, if you want to be swept up in an awesome adventure and don't mind a few tears, this is a masterful work of that genre.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"Grrat ""feel good"" movie for everyone. So much criticism about the messages in the movie about racism and political messages but hey we are in 2019 and lool at how much racism we still see everyday! And how mucj homophobia we see! It is important to teach younger generations that it is OK to be different and that role models exist in many different shapes and colours and sexual orientations.
People complaining that they are trying to ""push"" ways of living into our kids but im sorry, do you plan and having your kids live inside a glass blubble forever? I was always pushed the straight way of life and that did not make me straight, im still as gay as a spring day!
So go out and watch the movie and enjoy it!",5
A Dog's Way Home,"Loved it. Better than Benji, Lassie, and Old Yeller combined. Dog has an epic adventure trying to return to her ""person"" - lots of belly laughs, lots of tears. Plot and storyline was great, my 8 year old twin girls thoroughly loved it (and will probably watch it again once it comes out on Prime).",4
A Dog's Way Home,"My wife and I saw this movie. Smiled through the whole thing! Bring your kids, buy some popcorn and enjoy. I highly recommend this movie to the entire family.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"The movie was a bit corny with all the animals being sweet and many of the men being evil and mean but overall, it was a great movie to watch. If you love dogs, the movie was excellent. They even had some amazing CGI, drawing both the mountain lion and the main character dog to such a Perfection that you could not tell the difference. I highly recommend it.",5
A Dog's Way Home,"Bella is born a stray in the narrow space under an abandoned house. When the rest of her family is impounded she is adopted into a human household. But when she grows up her new family sends her far away from home.I got a lot more out of this movie than I expected. It was just starting to drag after about a quarter hour but then the dog gets separated and the adventure begins. It reminded me a lot of, 'The Incredible Journey (1963).'Great for young children. There is a little bit of threat.I particularly liked, 'Big Kitten.'",4
Okate Life,"Both the leads have such an endearing quality to them, their relationship seems so natural that you forget they are acting, the movie feels so real and makes the viewer become a part of the couple's life. Great acting, great writing on a couple's journey to become parents while holding on to their relationship. Simply endearing.",4
Okate Life,"... then you are clearly lucky enough to not have experienced infertility issues. The reason it's so long is because infertility is long. The reason the ending never reached a climax is because for some people, the journey to becoming parents never ends. If you consider these points then you'll see your complaints in a whole new light.I thought the acting was superb, I loved the candid, realistic portrayal of such a horrific and sensitive subject. Definitely recommend this film.",5
Okate Life,"Great actors and very appropriate casting of Giamatti and Hahn. I've loved this hysterical Katherine Hahn character ever since the series I Love Dick. Such a treat to see them together, and so natural! There really wasn't one moment where I felt like I was outside of the film looking in. It really captured (how I imagine!) this scenario to be, particularly the unsexiness of trying to get pregnant over and over. I also enjoyed the rebellious commentary from their niece on their art driven lifestyle, reminded me of crap I would've said in my first years at uni, haha. The focus on fertility, pregnancy, IVF cycles et al. can be a lil heavy and will probably deter the male audience (meh) but it is a film that I'd rather watch alone or with friends - not a date movie! Probably unrelated but something something like this actually happens in the film too...",4
Okate Life,"It is so rare for me to enjoy every single aspect of a film. The acting was superb. The writing was top shelf. Wonderful cast. Good sets. Enjoyable soundtrack. And I usually complain about two hours being too long but, in this case, I didn't mind at all and didn't want it to end. I don't remember when I've enjoyed a movie this much; there's so much junk out there. The only minor point I didn't like, and it's trivial, is putting a title on different scenes. Like a headline on a sub-text. I think I would've understood the transitions just fine without the titles.",5
Okate Life,"The whole film I was waiting for that high -- that relief to come and it never came. And that just very well may be how it is for those struggling with infertility. It definitely pulls you in and you forget you're watching a movie. Walking away from this I feel I have learned so much more about infertility, relationships etc ... 
Great acting, and great story telling.",5
Okate Life,"The entire cast turns in wonderful performances. The script is infused with droll humor, and the multiple instances of awkwardness come off as genuine, bolstered by sensitive pacing. The storyline feels a bit worn and redundant at times, but this might have been intentional, considering the subject matter. In contrast, many contemporary American films strive to include way too many plot points. The city scenes and interiors made me miss New York -- the production design was quite good. There are a few subtle surprises in the script which worked well. Highly recommended.",0
Okate Life,"An interesting portrait of a couple who tries everything to fulfill their dream and become parents but forgetting what their relationship is all about in the process. A very personal film that handles about a very personal topic, wonderfully put in scene and written by Tamara Jenkins who finally presents us a follow up project after ""The Savages"" and it is just as realistic and natural. To make a rather sad and to some extends tragic story a dramedy thanks to very well chosen comedic moments was the right decision. 
She found two great actors who both know how to do drama and comedy and the mix of that. Paul Giamatti absolutely shines and gives one of his best performances in ages. The quality of his performance goes back to his ""Sideways"" days. Kathryn Hahn once again proves her talent as one of the most underrated versatile actresses of her generation. Glad she got to show her acting powers in such a juicey role. John Caroll Lynch also gets to show that he not only can plays psychopaths and losers. Molly Shannon is wonderful in a supporting role and commands every scene she is in. Another great performance by another great and underrated actress.Kayli Carter is a great new discovery and she will go places.
An intimate portrait of a marriage that is put to a test. Absolutely recommendable.",4
Okate Life,"The movie was good I actually enjoyed it a lot, I felt deeply involved in the characters lives so never got bored. I just wish that the ending would have been better. It didn't even have to be a happy ending but they left it completely open ended after 2 hours of watching their struggle. I felt completely punked at the end.",3
Okate Life,It is a well done movie. Very delicate subject treated with humor and grace. Funny and realistic at the same time. It was pleasant surprise from Netflix. Good job.,5
Okate Life,"I found myself laughing at several moments. Very smooth and the characters were likeable. A difficult subject which was kept in perspective. The irony in the movie may be lost on some people and it did drag on longer than needed, but better than a lot of your 'franchised' drivel out there.",4
Okate Life,"I felt it was a very well done movie. Actors on spot, story line great, kept you interested. Not ONE dull moment. 
***Spoiler Alert***. The ending sucked. It was soooo bad I couldn't believe it. Why!! Why!! With all their
heartache why throw in another teaser on the prego experience at the end. A better ending would have been for their
niece to show up with her baby nine months later as a gift of love which was her intent to begin with. If the
Nine Months Later timeline printed on the screen was to maybe give the viewer that impression.... the director

It is absolutely NOT funny, AT ALL, EVER, Not at any point. The only really big emotion you get, all through the whole movie is depression.

Okate Life,"Obviously a film about infertility is going to carry a weight, and that should be expected by the viewer. That being said, this was marketed on Netflix as a comedy, so the frustration by viewers who wanted a funny feel good movie is understandable. I did not go into this expecting a comedy, so I was not disappointed. I enjoyed Private Life. The aesthetic of Richard and Rachel's apartment and style was visually appealing, and I think the various moods of the story were conveyed well. Richard and Rachel, and every character, are flawed people, portrayed as such in what I consider a very accurate way. The seemingly endless loop and obsession Rachel has with getting pregnant was hard to watch because you can see her pain, and as a viewer you want to reach out to her and pull her away from the tunnel vision she has, not because of Kathryn's acting (which is superb as usual). Sadie's personality is grating at times, but that's because she is a real, dimensional person who has facets and flaws. The relationship between her and Richard and Rachel is what you're meant to focus on. The relationships between all characters is what drives the story. In the end, this is just a look into the lives of a couple who are struggling immensely with infertility. It's a snapshot of what their lives have become now. The ending scene, where they sit in an Applebee's several states over, waiting for a donor who will probably never show up (yet again) further drives this home. There's no happy ending or message in here. This is just a story that starts and ends in the middle. Don't watch this expecting gut busting laughs, or a happy ending, don't watch this if you ""adore New York"" and then complain that it takes place mostly in an apartment. This isn't about New York, it's about infertility",4
Okate Life,Possibly the worst film I have ever ever seen. Nothing happens,1
Duppatlo Minnagu,"Both the leads have such an endearing quality to them, their relationship seems so natural that you forget they are acting, the movie feels so real and makes the viewer become a part of the couple's life. Great acting, great writing on a couple's journey to become parents while holding on to their relationship. Simply endearing.",4
Duppatlo Minnagu,"... then you are clearly lucky enough to not have experienced infertility issues. The reason it's so long is because infertility is long. The reason the ending never reached a climax is because for some people, the journey to becoming parents never ends. If you consider these points then you'll see your complaints in a whole new light.I thought the acting was superb, I loved the candid, realistic portrayal of such a horrific and sensitive subject. Definitely recommend this film.",5
Duppatlo Minnagu,"Great actors and very appropriate casting of Giamatti and Hahn. I've loved this hysterical Katherine Hahn character ever since the series I Love Dick. Such a treat to see them together, and so natural! There really wasn't one moment where I felt like I was outside of the film looking in. It really captured (how I imagine!) this scenario to be, particularly the unsexiness of trying to get pregnant over and over. I also enjoyed the rebellious commentary from their niece on their art driven lifestyle, reminded me of crap I would've said in my first years at uni, haha. The focus on fertility, pregnancy, IVF cycles et al. can be a lil heavy and will probably deter the male audience (meh) but it is a film that I'd rather watch alone or with friends - not a date movie! Probably unrelated but something something like this actually happens in the film too...",4
Duppatlo Minnagu,"It is so rare for me to enjoy every single aspect of a film. The acting was superb. The writing was top shelf. Wonderful cast. Good sets. Enjoyable soundtrack. And I usually complain about two hours being too long but, in this case, I didn't mind at all and didn't want it to end. I don't remember when I've enjoyed a movie this much; there's so much junk out there. The only minor point I didn't like, and it's trivial, is putting a title on different scenes. Like a headline on a sub-text. I think I would've understood the transitions just fine without the titles.",5
Duppatlo Minnagu,"The whole film I was waiting for that high -- that relief to come and it never came. And that just very well may be how it is for those struggling with infertility. It definitely pulls you in and you forget you're watching a movie. Walking away from this I feel I have learned so much more about infertility, relationships etc ... 
Great acting, and great story telling.",5
Duppatlo Minnagu,"The entire cast turns in wonderful performances. The script is infused with droll humor, and the multiple instances of awkwardness come off as genuine, bolstered by sensitive pacing. The storyline feels a bit worn and redundant at times, but this might have been intentional, considering the subject matter. In contrast, many contemporary American films strive to include way too many plot points. The city scenes and interiors made me miss New York -- the production design was quite good. There are a few subtle surprises in the script which worked well. Highly recommended.",0
Duppatlo Minnagu,"An interesting portrait of a couple who tries everything to fulfill their dream and become parents but forgetting what their relationship is all about in the process. A very personal film that handles about a very personal topic, wonderfully put in scene and written by Tamara Jenkins who finally presents us a follow up project after ""The Savages"" and it is just as realistic and natural. To make a rather sad and to some extends tragic story a dramedy thanks to very well chosen comedic moments was the right decision. 
She found two great actors who both know how to do drama and comedy and the mix of that. Paul Giamatti absolutely shines and gives one of his best performances in ages. The quality of his performance goes back to his ""Sideways"" days. Kathryn Hahn once again proves her talent as one of the most underrated versatile actresses of her generation. Glad she got to show her acting powers in such a juicey role. John Caroll Lynch also gets to show that he not only can plays psychopaths and losers. Molly Shannon is wonderful in a supporting role and commands every scene she is in. Another great performance by another great and underrated actress.Kayli Carter is a great new discovery and she will go places.
An intimate portrait of a marriage that is put to a test. Absolutely recommendable.",4
Duppatlo Minnagu,"The movie was good I actually enjoyed it a lot, I felt deeply involved in the characters lives so never got bored. I just wish that the ending would have been better. It didn't even have to be a happy ending but they left it completely open ended after 2 hours of watching their struggle. I felt completely punked at the end.",3
Duppatlo Minnagu,It is a well done movie. Very delicate subject treated with humor and grace. Funny and realistic at the same time. It was pleasant surprise from Netflix. Good job.,5
Duppatlo Minnagu,"I found myself laughing at several moments. Very smooth and the characters were likeable. A difficult subject which was kept in perspective. The irony in the movie may be lost on some people and it did drag on longer than needed, but better than a lot of your 'franchised' drivel out there.",4
Duppatlo Minnagu,"I felt it was a very well done movie. Actors on spot, story line great, kept you interested. Not ONE dull moment. 
***Spoiler Alert***. The ending sucked. It was soooo bad I couldn't believe it. Why!! Why!! With all their
heartache why throw in another teaser on the prego experience at the end. A better ending would have been for their
niece to show up with her baby nine months later as a gift of love which was her intent to begin with. If the
Nine Months Later timeline printed on the screen was to maybe give the viewer that impression.... the director

Duppatlo Minnagu,Possibly the worst film I have ever ever seen. Nothing happens,1
After,"There were parts of this movie that were romantic and left everyone in the cinema feeling smitten. However, having read the books, I have a few bones to pick.The beginning was quite rushed so their relationship was not developed well. One second they meet each other and the next they are already at the lake ... and anyone who has seen the movie or read the book knows what happens at the lake; it was all too fast for me to truly feel happy and excited that they are finally getting together.The movie was oddly PG. Anyone who has read the books will know that the books are a lot more passionate. It is confusing as to why a story about college students is kept so PG when college students in general aren't PG. They adapted a very intimate and non-PG book into a PG movie, which many who read the book might be disappointed by, as I was.This is an oddly specific bone to pick, but: I felt the placement of the scene where they argue in class over Elizabeth Bennet came too soon. They are in essence arguing about Tessa being interested in Hardin, but by then that didn't seem like an issue. Perhaps this scene would have made more sense being after the lake and restaurant scene where she does confront him about whether he is embarrassed to be seen with her. But, what is done is done.Lastly, the movie did not portray the essence of the love-hate relationship in the book. Where was Hardin's jealousy and possessiveness? Where was Tessa's attitude towards Hardin? They tried to capture the complicated nature of Hardin's character when he tells the story of his drunken father and his mother whilst at his dad's wedding, but there was no development on this - I didn't see emphasis on the relationship issues he seemed to have in the book. Also, in the book I myself had a love-hate relationship with Hardin's character, but in the movie I simply just enjoyed looking at Hero Fiennes-Tiffin considering how good looking he is.All in all, it was still an enjoyable movie and I could tell a lot of hard work went into it. The movie was beautiful to watch, especially the lake scene and the bathtub scene (which was an especially cute scene). I also have appreciation for the attention to consent and safe sex practices. Casting was done well; Josephine Langford (Tessa) and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (Hardin) we're extremely well suited to their characters, but I feel they could have done more with their characters if they were given the opportunity.The romantic scenes were cute and made me smile, but the movie lacked the deeper layer that the book has about how complicated people can be, and the message of learning to love someone despite their flaws as well as trying to be a better person for the one you love. Considering Ana Todd (the author of After) was on set all the time, I am confused as to why she allowed the movie to stray so far from the core messages of the book.Small details of the book were included and did leave a smile on my face when they came up as they reminded me of the effect the book initially had on me, but the bigger-picture messages and themes of the book seemed missing.Viewers who have not read the book may be confused by the fast pace, as I used a lot of my knowledge from the book to fill in gaps.Reading the book does cloud my judgement, so I would like to emphasize that it was still a good movie which I plan to rewatch many times.Should you watch this movie? Yes.Do I want a sequel? Yes; I am hoping much of what was left out in this movie was because they plan to make a sequel, one which is more passionate and explores the complicated nature of Hardin and Tessa. The movie did not have the same effect on me as the book did, but I would still watch it again and tell others to watch it.",4
After,"I may be bias because I read and loved the books but it was a great movie. Just like any indie movie just starting out, it has its flaws. I felt because I read the book I noticed how rushed it was and all the changes but it wasnt that bad. The chemistry is amazing, the actors were great and it brought me back to when I watched you drive me crazy, shes all that and cruel intentions. Definitely gave me that throwback vibe and cult classic.",5
After,"I went to see this film with my hopes high since I have read the books multiple times and I absolutely loved them.
Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you're going to be really disappointed as well. If you haven't, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don't really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book.
I feel like the characters didn't show much emotion. Hardin I just didn't feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.PLEASE GO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WATCH SOMETHING BETTER",1
After,"Poor acting. The relationships were shallow and underdeveloped. The film overall was really really bad, to the point that I almost went out of the theater.",1
After,"Clearly NO ONE involved in this movie read the books! The only thing they got right was the characters names! That's it. It was a completely different story than the book. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. I've seen more passion in a Hallmark movie. Seriously, don't waste your money or time.",1
After,"If you love high school romances with full of drama and love then you should watch After. I really loved the books but I didn't like the Hardin of the books instead I fell in love with the Hardin of the movie . Great cast with new faces , something fresh and romantic to see . It really reminds you your first love and I really hope for the sequels",5
After,"After is the kind of film that could have gone horribly wrong. Well, it had all the ingredients - good girl, bad girls, brooding mysterious college hottie, wannabe college teens sporting nose piercings & tattoos, dysfunctional families & broken marriages..the list will go on. But what trumps all of this the heavyduty emotional texture of the film. The intense romance that develops between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet very mystical way. There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really uncanny will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Makeout scenes are aplenty but none OTT. They are aesthetic and complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles that well with his young, good looking actors keeping their next-door image intact. Audience will relate with their characters and root for both of them. Pace is slow but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Overall, AFTER is the kind of college romance everyone hopes for - it's got love, lust and heartbreak in equal measure!",4
After,"This movie is your typical good girl meets bad boy romance, so as for plot twists, can't say there were many. The acting was average at best, but it wasn't like the characters were exactly the most complex to portray, so I suppose the actors did their job. In addition, the characters either fit complete stereotypes or simply did not have any personalities at all. Side note: I refuse to applaud Anna Todd for making the movie ""diverse"". She made Tristan a girl, which would have been interesting had Pia Mia been on the screen for more than 4 minutes. Anyone else getting the same queerbaiting vibes as Riverdale? And representing the African American community with Landon wouldn't have been a problem had he had more duties than being the typical 'black best friend's stereotype.The biggest thieves of the screens were the two main characters, Tessa and Hardin. The movie focused much more on the romance between them rather than them as individual people with separate stories and personalities. For a movie that bragged about encouraging empowerment, they sure made Tessa seem dependent on Hardin and hinted at her being irrelevant without Hardin. I mean, a lot of romance movies are guilty of this, but still, it makes for some pretty unrelatable and boring characters, especially the female lead. Another side note: Josephine Langford is an okay actress, however the producers should have told her that her Australian accent came through way too much and asked her to do the scene again. The editing was a bit odd, including a lot of shots of characters just staring at each other and extreme close ups of body parts and objects. Jenny Gage was way too dependent on montages to save this film. In terms of plot, some of the character motives were lost in the fast-paced nature of the film. Believe me, it was incredibly too fast. This is something that happens a lot in book to film adaptations, since it is very difficult to cram what would be a 10 hour reading session in a 2 hour movie, but still, they could have tried a bit harder. Instead of trying to stuff a film with new scenes that have zero relevance, this movie should have at least tried to include scenes from the book that may have been a waste of time as well but at least they weren't brought out of thin air. This movie was, well, forgettable. Beyond average and disappointing. Overall, it just blends in with the rest of the teen romance genre, if anything being a flop to others in that category.",1
After,"We died laughing in the cinema, because it was so ridiculousy predictable and stupid. Don't spend your money or time. I am telling you, no!",1
After,"I loved the movie. Reading the books and being so in love with them I was SO excited for this movie. If you're a true fan of the book then you should seriously just be glad you even have actual characters played out in front of you! You could tell the story was there! There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn't making it exactly like the book itself, it's taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own! I love the curve they took with the film & I would give anything for them to be able to make sequels! What does it hurt anyone to be supportive of something others are passionate about!? I'm proud & in love with this film! I'm angry about people just not being supportive!",5
After,"I personally loved this movie. It's beautifully shot and the actors have an amazing chemistry. I read the books back in 2014 and the author herself said that the movie is going to be different since you can't really fit a 400 pages book in 100 minutes. The changes that they made were necessary in my opinion and I prefer the ""softer"" Hardin from the movie. The movie has a great message and shouldn't be getting so much hate just because it's not exactly like the books. 10/10 from me. Hoping for a second one! People should watch it with an open mind.",5
After,"First things first, I clearly do not belong to the intended audience which is probably narrowed to female and romantic teens, between 11 and 17 years old. Possibly older, with a touch of nostalgia. Tessa, an ingenuous teen, leaves home, mum and high school in order to integrate university, her roommate inviting her to join an idle and carefree group. She meets there Hardin, a rebel without a cause (Nicholas Ray, 1956) but with a keen interest in literature, like herself. The continuation is relatively predictable and indubitably goofy. My own rating: 2/3 over 10. My rating while trying to belong to the intended audience, with a generous empathy boosted to the extreme: 4/5 over 10.",2
After,"I think the movie captured the essence of the book. It's quite impossible to make it 100% true to the book. I liked the adaptions, they made sense considering the length of the movie. The cemestry between Hero and Josephine is amazing, they did a wonderful job. Hardin is a bit softer than in the book, but I don't mind that at all because it's perfect for the movie. Some things happens really fast, but again an adaption I can live with because it works for the movie. The ending is so sweet and beautiful and I hope for more After movies. Overall love the books love the movie I'm a happy Afternator.",5
After,"This was a bad movie, It's a really empty movie, nothing happened! the character didn't have any chemistry, no dialog, this was a waste of time and money, my life deserves better. i almost stab my eyes with a fork. i prefer to see my eyes bleeding than to see this empty movie.",1
After,"I think the movie captures the essence of the book beautifully. It's an adaptation so the changes were necessary, the end result came together perfectly.",5
After,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I loved it because it was a true ADAPTATION of the After books which .... were not my favorite read to be honest. This movie fixed everything that I didn't like about the books. For example, it brought a diversity of personalities which you don't see in the books and there were way less ""Tessa crying"" moments, which were so repetitive in the books. HERO played Hardin AMAZINGLY WELL. I never thought they could find an actor who would so closely resemble Hardin--but they did. I remember Hero playing the young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and I knew instantly that his career would take off when he got older. His ability to play dark, brooding characters is truly phenomenal.Josephine was absolutely beautiful, confident and strong. She is the Tessa I prefer to the Tessa in the books. Her smile, her eyes, her voice, everything she did was perfect. She LOOKED exactly as I pictured in my head.For those diehard fans of After that didn't like it, I truly feel bad. However, movies are never like the books.....take Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings just as a few examples.This movie is so romantic and beautifully filmed. It is not a waste of your money so please go see it!!!!!!!!!!!",5
After,"This movie is based off of the wattpad series by Anna Todd which was a great hit obviously. The book itself was incredibly addicting and so realistic and amazing. The movie did a wonderful job to create that feeling again and the cast and crew were just so amazing. The movie is about coming of age , boy meets girl . There's definitely more to it but I'll leave it for y'all to see. I loved every second of it and would watch it a billion more times , if you have not read the books definitely check them out. Praying for a sequel!!",5
After,"The film is incredible, all changes were necessary, do not enter the movie theater thinking that you will see the book written in image, you will see After 2019, an improved and amazing version!! I love",5
After,Honestly I have been waiting for this movie for ages !! Since I love all the books so much! The movie was really interesting to me and I didn't feel board thoughout the whole thing. The movie and the book are very different to each other but still similar to each other in another way which was a nice new take on the story. The new scenes that were added in the movie were really cute and fun to watch too. I think both Hero and Josephine did a great job in portraying Hardin and Tessa. Josephine is really what I pictured Tessa to look and be like and her acting was enjoyable. Hero was amazing!! I loved his portrayal of Hardin Scoot I thought he did a fantastic job even though Hardin was a lot more softer in the movie than in the book which didn't really please me and a fan of the book but I felt it worked well with the story line of the movie. However even though I enjoyed the film sooooo much as a fan of the book I feel like some characters weren't played to their full potential in the movie my main concern was the absence of Zed's infatuation with Tessa which was very much present in the books but not in the film. The other characters also didn't get much screen time in the movie which was a shame as you couldn't see their true personalities but none the less I still enjoyed the film very much and I hope that there will be a sequel to the movie as there is a lot more to the story of Hardin and Tessa,5
After,"Well I wasn't expecting too much about this movie but I never thought it was this bad, omg it was so creepy to watch mainly their first time!!! What the hell was that? ""are you ready?"" and open the condom with the teeth and how can you put a freaking condom with one hand???Before you even start with the excuse ""you didn't read the books"" YES I read the books and there was essential parts that it should be in the movie, like Hardin forcing Tessa telling Noah that she was with him during the night, or the REAL MOTIVE of the bet, or Landon's and Tessa's friendship AND the most important thing Tessa's thing with Zed!!!! But no, instead you only focus on Tessa and Hardin kissing all movie, constantly looks for each other, her sighs...The movie itself wasn't worth it to watch because it all happened so fast most of the scenes didn't happened in the books... gosh I'm going to try to forget that this movie ever happened.",1
After,"Imagine hitting your head against a wall for two hours. That would probably be better than seeing this movie. Everything about it was cliche; the characters, the plot, everything. The plot felt like your average teen/young adult drama but worse. The ""tension"", if it could be called that at the end of the movie with the two main characters breaking up was pointless when the got back together. I mean, even the characters themselves were just cookie cutter characters that you'd see in every teen drama. Tessa, the stereotypical ""I'm-not-like-the-other-girls"" girl, who's doing her best in school until she meets the bad boy with a dark past, Hardin, who's edgy but likes literature and has a soft spot deep in him. Landon and Tessa's roommate being the stereotypical token charatacters to appeal to anyone and always give Tessa ""good advice."" The only times I really got laughs out of the movie where in spots I definitely don't think I was supposed to be laughing. I get this was originally fanfiction, but wow. Wow. Yikes.",1
After,It's an infinite symbol tattoo made into a movie. The whole movie is a clich of what a high school girl considers romantic but its neither romantic or enjoyable.,1
After,"This movie was done beautifully and way better than I expected!!!! if you've read the book before it's best to keep an open mind because no movie will turn out exactly how it's told in it's novel. The cast and crew did an amazing job at telling Hardin and Tessa's love story, yes of course there could've been some minor changes but overall the movie was amazing and after waiting five years for my favorite novel to be made into a movie, it truly did not disappoint!!! Truly am hoping for a second movie so their story can be told in more detail !",5
After,"Coming from a person who has read the books from the start, the movie is amazing! For people who have read them all as well, I just want to say that it is best to walk into the theater with an open mind due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to fit an entire 600 pages into a film. Some things are changed from the novel and in my opinion I think it is for the best because I will admit...the book can be a little harsh for the big screen BUT 'After' is NOT romanticizing an abusive relationship. It is about two non-perfect people who find each other in the dark and bring light at the end. It's not a fairy tale story but it is a real one. A real life story that needs to be told considering the fact that there are people around the world who, more or less, have the same storyline as Tessa and Hardin. Personally speaking, I believe that everyone (read the books or not) will love this film! It's different from other romance movies and it is something new to people. It will leave the audience lost for words and wanting more for a sequel!!!",4
After,"Did you read the book? I know that isn't the best (at least have more passion and connection with the characters) but... THE MOVIE IS EVEN WORST. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFERENT, did you see Harry Styles? HE IS BEAUTIFUL, and have Muscles, but the actor? NO, He isn't even the middle of him. And don't have any similar to Hardin, and don't look like the ""bad boy"" that he is. So if you want to spend unnecessary your money, may you can go to see this movie, but I'm going to say it just once, it's a bad movie inspires in a book without have a big similar more than the plot, because the characters are so bad represented.",1
Danger Love Story,"Cassie is a new writer and in order to promote her book her editor proposes she goes on a book tour with their most famous writer, Elliot. Road trip time! During the ride, they read each others books and become close. (Don't they always?)I really liked this concept. If there is a book I will probably love it. Jen Lilley's character, as most of the them, is an amiable person. Kevin McGarry is becoming one of my favorite and I thought their chemistry was good. They actually made me laugh at the end. Speaking of the ending... I didn't think the last three minutes were bad, they did the best they could with the HORRIBLE AND DRAMATIC pre-ending (my word for it) problem. Which I hated. We had had worst endings, that were extremely rushed (proposals), but the last scene was even adorable.To sum up, it was a cute movie. So was the dog.",4
Danger Love Story,"So cute! I wish the inns and cabins they stayed at were real places to visit - they look so cozy! I actually really liked the ending! Also, it was funny to see what was supposed to be Princeton, New York, Boston, Albany and Buffalo! (all places I've either lived or have close family who live there) I look forward to seeing both Jen Lilley and Kevin McGarry in more Hallmark movies!",3
Danger Love Story,"Bookstores? Really? Hallmark writers live in the 1990s.
However, Jen Lilly is super cute and full of life, lifting this pedestrian movie up over the drek that Hallmark puts out this time of year.
And Mary-Margaret Humes is criminally underused.
And as for the critic above who hated the ending, too bad. It's the ending I wanted.",4
Danger Love Story,"This entertaining story follows the standard hallmark movie formula but manages to rise above it. Would've been much better if the female lead character hadn't been such an insecure spoiled brat that you wonder why any of the people around her even try. But the guy does and makes up for her shortcomings. It helps that the two actors have good chemistry, and that the male character is so likeable.",4
Danger Love Story,Jen Lilley and Kevin McGarry play authors on a book tour together and of course romance ensues. He is a successful fantasy writer and she does romance. There is some witty banter along the way a bit more sparkling than the usual Hallmark romance.,3
Danger Love Story,"Actually, not a bad story, but nothing unexpected.Kevin McGarry had good chemistry with Jen Lilly, but for me, Lilly doesn't have the same energy. She does do her professional shyness well.I hated the way the ending was handled. It's not an uncommon approach, but I never liked that approach.",3
Danger Love Story,"Character development was tiresome. The star's part was written poorly. If I was the character's publisher I would have fired her and moved on to someone that appreciated the opportunity granted.
Director should have moved her along to a more positive person way earlier... she sincerely seemed incompetent.",2
Danger Love Story,Loved this movie so much.. wish a sequel could be done to see where it goes..,5
Total Dhamaal,"TOTAL DHAMAAL1: A very over hipped up film for the masses which contains a lot of sleazy and predictable comedy.Now if this film would have released in say the beginning of 2018 then maybe it could have won the masses hearts but with the success of badhai ho etc the masses have also decided to love good stories and not the cast so now let us go to our section which isThings that may work1. CAST: The biggest thing that can bring the audience to the theater is the cast which mostly all these big budget films try to do. The mantra for success for a hit in India is the *CAST BRINGS THE MASS*2.CHILDREN: The reason why many people will go although even not liking the content is the children. Kids need such films THEY CAN'T BE BORN AS CRITICS RIGHT? If you are dying to get the sweet kiss from your kid then don't read this review and just go to the hall and enjoy3. DHAMAAL: the first film of the franchise has a fair amount of cult. Hence the people may go for it seeking a similar filmTHING WHICH MAY NOT WORK1. WORD OF MOUTH: Mark my word this film is not going to get a good word of mouth as till the end of the film you feel the sense of sleaze and would not try to experience this again.2 NO CREATIVITY: I hate films which are made with the same story but with a bigger budget (e.g baaghi 2)coz the story of this film is just the same as Jamaal
DHAMAAL TOTAL DHAMAAL
The secret was of ten crores The secret is of 50 crores
The classic helicopter scene The same helicopter scene
The same ending
NOW let's MOVE ON TO THE REVIEWActing: To be frank none of the actors put an impact on me at the end.No one could be remembered like KAMLI (Sanju). Even great actors like Sanjay Mishra and Ajay Devgn didn't put an impact on me Sanjay Mishra kept on calling Ajay Devgn bro and after a point it became irritating.SONGS: The songs of the film is PURE S***. I Hated them the lyrics are less the background score is louder and irritating.WRITING: THERE IS NOT MUCH WRITING DONE FOR THIS FILM EXCEPT FOR BRO BRO BRO BRO BRO AND SOME STUPID SLAPSTICK PUNCHESSCREENPLAY: SCREENPLAY IS LAZILY PENNED. EACH CHARACTER DOES NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE DOING AND WHAT.VFX: The only thing to go for this film is the vfx IF YOU LIKE TO WATCH SUCH STUFF THEN GO FOR ITANIMALS: The adventure part of the film with animals is also a thing to go for but if i just wanted to see animals on screen then i would rather go to a zoo.FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY WITH KIDS THEN DO GO FOR THIS FILM. BUT IF YOUR FAMILY IS INTERESTED IN GOOD CINEMA THEN DON'T JAM YOUR HEADS AND EMPTY YOUR POCKETS ON THIS FILM. I would rather watch GULLY BOY OR URI THIS WEEK IF I WOULD BE GOING ALONE.RATING

Total Dhamaal,"If you've really enjoyed the first Dhammal and hoping for the same with this one, then I tell you what you will be painfully disappointed. The plot, dialogues and action scenes all are just too much to digest. Total overacting should have been the title of this one.

Total Dhamaal,"Really it feels me that Total Dhamaal had Proven that Bollywood's future is on Doomsday. Worst, Worthless, Hopeless, Stupid movie ever. Just only a poor copy of Dhamaal with VFX only.

Romeo Akbar Walter,"I think people downrating it comparing it to Raazi are misguided. The overall story is much more complex than Raazi. I do think that it could have done with more deft execution but I didn't find it as slow as websites are saying. Reviews by media houses are pathologically biased because the movie is based on a nationalistic theme. Its definitely not a bore and is pretty intense especially in the second half. It's not overtly jingoistic and maintains a good realistic tone. Infact, the conclusion is much better than Raazi. I felt that the story with Mouni Roy could have been done away with. The true surprise is Jackie Shroff. He's a complete show stealer. Overall its a solid 8 from me.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"I'm astonished at two things. 1) This well made, riveting espionage thriller. 2) How low can the paid media and biased reviewers can stoop down to negatively project the movie for no reason. There is nothing political or jingoistic about this movie but the right amount of patriotism, good story-telling, cinematography, direction and awesome twist! this movie is based on true events/inspired by the story of the RAW agent Ravindra Kaushik (aka Black Tiger) but not exactly his story. However, this is tribute to all those unsung heroes who sacrifice everything in order to protect the Motherland from inside the enemy territories.
John Abraham did well, Jackie Shroff was pretty good, Sikander Kher was good and the others performed decent too. The movie could use better editing and handling of some loopholes but it's still a realistic and pretty good watch. Somehow I liked it even more than Raazi. So don't listen to the negative reviews and watch it yourself.
Some people are giving it low ratings purposely because perhaps they still can't digest the truth about 1971 Bangladesh liberation war/Indo-Pak war.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,Good movie could have been a little faster and therefore used the spare time for further character and plot development.,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,It's a fantastic movie with great screenplay it's not typical bollywood it's par with Hollywood real drama it's slow but it's super script which need to be understand with every scene which are above average human understanding limits which is why its intelligence people movie,5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Loved the movie. It is a must watch. The detailing for a film set in the 1970's is amazing. Everything, right from the dressing style to the hairstyles, to the gadgets, to the vehicles... It reflects the era in which the film is set.
John Abraham, Jackie Shroff, Sikander Kher, Anil George... All have done a wonderful job. The art direction is awesome and so is the direction.
Just felt that Mouni Roy's character was not developed well enough. The romantic angle did not need to be there.
Other than that, the film is fantastic.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Not sure about the other reviews but I think it was definitely a good script, good acting. Worth 8 stars.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Don't let yourself getting fooled by these paid critics.this movie is definitely must watch for the serious and real movie lovers.john Abraham is tailor-made for such as he did in Madras Cafe and rocky handsome,he is terrific again.other supporting cast are good too.this movie tries to cover all aspects.definitely a must watch for serious and raw movie lovers 9/10",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Romeo Akbar Walter is an impressive action thriller that however might not impress die-hard thriller fans, largely because the twists (except a few) and suspenseful moments are pretty much predictable. This doesn't really harm the film since it's gripping and frequently gives up tension and action throughout the duration.I'd say that the trailers pretty much spoiled the film. After watching the film, I really feel they shouldn't have given some integral parts in the promos because that kills the surprise factor, although the director provides another twist to cover for it. Robbie Grewal has done a decent job but he has added songs too randomly. A film like this doesn't need singing and love tracks even if short.The first half is gripping and the plotting is excellent. The interval twist is outstanding. That's the one thing I can call truly unpredictable. The second half also goes on to take the conflict further and several scenes are outstanding. I must also mention that the emotional moments are captivating from start to finish and the action sequences are also very impressively staged, most notably the chase that is all over the promos. There is, however, some extreme violence, so be warned. I could already see and hear the audience getting terrified during one such scene.John Abraham delivers a terrific act. Jackie Shroff also occasionally performs well. Mouni Roy just happens to be there. The villains are menacing and the complex relations between characters are one of the many things this film gets right. The weather depicted throughout the duration makes its presence felt. The climax is also impressive, even though it feels a little stretched.Romeo Akbar Walter is not the most unique spy film largely because those familiar with movies about espionage won't find it surprising. Still, I liked the film a lot and didn't feel bored or exhausted for even a second. I wanted a dramatic action thriller, and that's what I got. That being said, RAW will not disappoint action fans either. It's really enjoyable and worth watching also due to its interesting espionage theme that appeals to viewers of all ages.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Guys, a great watch I must say. I like the story and the direction, it will keep you on the edge with every scene.
End is a twist",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,Nature of the film is diffrent than others its a good film good direction and cinematography John Abraham's performance is damn good.except the laging of first half the film gives a superb second half and a mindich blowing climax.in the secind half lots of twists and turns there overall good film worth to watch,4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Watching this movie, One can understand the difficulty of being a spy and missing family. There are many such agents whose identity is kept secret and there sacrifice has helped the nation.",5

Romeo Akbar Walter,"This film is for those who knows little/more about history specially with Indian wars. For them it's great thriller experience. For others they may not like much, as they expected one of the masala movie.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"First of all this movie is based on a true story. Yes, there was a raw agent in real as depicted in the movie. It's not like any other raw movies of Bollywood like -ek tha tiger. You should definitely watch this movie. And yes there are many twists and turns but in the later half of the movie. The first part is quite pridictable.",5

Romeo Akbar Walter,"I would definitely recommend this movie..A mustwatch!The honesty in the story and sincerity in the acting touches you. The at direction is perfect.. Transports you back to the 70's.John is fabulous in his emotions, Jackie very suave, Sikandar nailed the accent, and of course the acting by Raghuveer Yadav and Anil George are commendable. Even the smallest of roles , the beggar for instance, are superbly taken care of and well directed.The first half is slow paced, but is perfect to establish the characters and second half keeps you on the edge of your seats.Mouni's character doesn't work in the film.The director,Robbie, has done a great work... The film evokes patriotic feeling and touches you. It gives you an insight on how the RAW agents work...salutes to them.",5
Romeo Akbar Walter,"There must be some code and ethic one should stick to.
Going to a different nation and marrying their daughter, having your child is going too far.
Both of their life must have turn upside down when they got to know that their beloved father is a spy.
They are dead now.",1
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Forgiving plotholes, the film has good storyline and decent twists. Sikander Kher looks most realistic with his Pakistani accent. I wish other actors did that too.However, narration is too slow for most part and the tension doesn't quite build up like in the similar spy movie Raazi.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"Brief Synopsis:
Set in the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh war, RAW tells the story of Romeo (John Abraham), a bank cashier who is hired by RAW to infiltrate into Pakistan and pass on covert information to them. What happens when the cover of the blue eyed boy of RAW is blown? Is he disowned by his own people? Is he just treated as a pawn in the bigger scheme of things? Does he become a liability to his own government, someone who is easily dispensable? This forms the rest of the plot.Review:
John Abraham as the master of disguise (Romeo, Akbar and Walter) gets into the character with ease, displaying various emotions like fear when he is first recruited by RAW; angst, when he is disowned by his own when his cover is blown & presence of mind when he is confronted with difficult situations while trying to spy on Paki officials with ease. Really the Ace in the pack of cards.Sikandar Kher, as Col Khan from the ISI does a great job as a sadist who enjoys pulling out peoples nails as a part of the third degree torture while humming a sweet song.
Jackie as the RAW chief Srikant Rai gives a restrained performance and is one of the strongest links which binds the film together.Rest of the cast like Raghuvir Yadav, Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Mouni Roy have also done a decent job with their small but well etched out characters.Why is the film not as gripping as Raazi?Though a decent one time watch & despite dwelling in the same genre as Raazi which was an awesome film to say the least, RAW falters a bit with its lack of past paced action owing to the slow narrative inspite of a stellar cast. This is unfortunately what brings the film down by a notch when compared to Raazi which had all of the above.There is a twist in the tale at the climax but it is so far-fetched that probably even the popping out of Jim Carrey's eyes in the film MASK would seem normal to most.But to cut the makers some slack, RAW has its moments, though not enough to keep the audiences glued to their seats (I was yawning a bit in the first half due to the slow narrative). The length of the film should have been reduced by 15-20 mins.Verdict:
A one time watch, not bad yet not too gripping for a film in this genre. I would ideally give it 6.5 stars out of 10 ......but am tempted to add half a star more for the effort put in by the makers. Watch it in the theatres without raising the bar too high and you won't be disappointed.",4
Romeo Akbar Walter,"ROMEO AKBAR WALTER is the story of a patriot who takes extreme risks while spying in enemy country. The year is 1971. Romeo Ali (John Abraham) works in India in a bank. He stays with his mother Waheeda (Alka Amin) who is overprotective about him since Romeo's father had died while serving the country. Romeo too has the passion to work for India but is unable to do so due to his mother. However one day he meets Shrikant Rao (Jackie Shroff), head of RAW, and he asks Romeo to join them and spy on Pakistanis on their soil. Romeo agrees and before leaving for training and eventual trip to Pakistan, he lies to his mother that he has been promoted in the bank and that that's why he has been sent for training. In Pakistan, he manages to smartly win the trust of arms dealer Isaq Afridi (Anil George), who's very close to General Zorawar (Purnendu Bhattacharya). While spying on their conversations and activities, Romeo stumbles upon an important information. The Pakistani forces are planning an air strike in Badlipur area of the then East Pakistan. This part of Pakistan is getting rebellious and wants independence. The rebels meanwhile are being trained by Indian forces and a lot of them are stationed at Badlipur, where the Pakistanis plan to drop bombs. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Robbie Grewal's story is promising and could have made for an exciting thriller. Robbie Grewal and Rahul Sen Gupta's screenplay however is very weak and flawed. The scenes don't flow well and the narrative is quite incoherent. Audiences might not be able to easily comprehend what's going on. There are too many loopholes that even a layman will be able to point out. Robbie Grewal, Ishraq Eba and Shreyansh Pandey's dialogues are well worded but nothing memorable.Robbie Grewal's direction is not upto the mark. It is evident that he has put in a lot of research but it's of no use when you are not able to use it well. Moreover, audiences won't be able to help but compare the proceedings with RAAZI and it was a far superior product. So this factor also comes in play. Except for the final scene, one doesn't root for Romeo. His bond with his mother seems half baked. Even the romantic track with Parul (Mouni Roy) seems forced. The makers don't even bother to show what happens to Parul later on.John Abraham gives his hundred per cent. The film might disappoint but he won't. His deadpan expressions work very well for his character. Mouni Roy has an interesting part to essay. Though she does well, her character gets a raw deal. Jackie Shroff is dependable but at places, it's difficult to understand what he's speaking. Sikandar Kher oozes fear and terror and gets the accent right. Suchitra Krishnamoorthi (Rehana Kazmi) is fine but has very little to do. Anil George is damn impressive. Raghubir Yadav (Mudassar) leaves a mark. Purnendu Bhattacharya is okay. Rajesh Shringapure (Awasthi) and Nawab Afridi (Shadaab Amjad Khan) do well.The music has no scope and seems forced. 'Bulleya' fails to strike a chord. 'Maa' is forcefully added. 'Vande Mataram' is played in the end credits. 'Allah Hoo Allah' is needless while 'Jee Len De' is there for just a minute. Hanif Shaikh's background score is quite loud but works in enhancing impact.Tapan Tushar Basu's cinematography is appropriate. Madhur Madhavan and Swapnil Bhalerao's production design gives the film a nice retro touch. Same goes for Ameira Punvani's costumes. The clothes worn by Mouni is in sync with the era shown. Prana and Pixel D's VFX is passable. Nilesh Girdhar's editing is quite slow and the film is too long at 144 minutes.",2
Romeo Akbar Walter,"First thing first, RAW - Romeo Akbar Walter is a slow burner and demands your patience for a good amount of the first hour. And once you blend in, it's a highly engaging and interesting spy drama.Based in 1971, RAW - Romeo Akbar Walter is about a banker Rehmat Ali aka Romeo, who is chosen by the RAW chief (Jackie Shroff) to be an Indian spy in Pakistan.Romeo takes the identity of Akbar Malik and migrates to Pakistan. The rest of the movie is about how Akbar helped India during the period that led to the 1971 war and his journey to becoming Walter.The first half, in particular, is quite dawdling and takes its own time for the setup and build up. For the first hour, you might feel that nothing's really happening and many scenes may seem unnecesary, but by the end of the film, it all makes sense. The writing is good. The screenplay is uneven.Sonu Nigam's Vande Mataram song is good.John Abraham has performed well. Playing a spy.RAW would have been a great film if not for its extremely slow pace in the first half and a run time which is almost two and a half hour,, but The last act makes a film.You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you've got a hit."" Romeo Akbar Walter falls in that category..!",3

Hellboy,"I strongly urge anyone that considers themselves a fan of #Hellboy, the comics, the characters and not just the #GuillermodelToro/#RonPerlman films, please go see this film. This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.I hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.If you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film.",4
Hellboy,"The new Hellboy was a helluva good time. Yes, it's different from the previous two films. But give it a chance. Harbour does a fantastic job as Hellboy. And the movie draws far more on the source/comic material than the previous films. If you loved the comics, you'll enjoy this movie. Plenty of humor, action, and fantasy to hold your interest.",5
Hellboy,"Not your typical superhero comic. But really entertaining me throughout the end. Gory, dark humour, sassy hellboy. Fists and fights, not much of cheesy lines. I love it!",5
Hellboy,"Yet another big blockbuster action movie based on a comic is the base of Hellboy. A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good, but it was the opposite. If you enjoy the comic books or are a fan of action and science fiction, you might even enjoy this movie. If you're not stay away. Could have been better. Decent acting, Good effects but very lousy story. Nevertheless, they were still entertaining !!",4
Hellboy,It never hurts to be reminded that an Apocalypse is likely to be an horrific event. A handful of shots and scenes in Hellboy deserve to be quickly swept under the carpet of the subconscious. One sequence in particular I found granted the movie it's R rating. Much of it is beyond the pale ... what you'd expect walking in to a R-rated movie. Based on the tone throughout this fillem I think it highly logical that the conclusion was reigned in a good deal. That's not to give anything away because there is a stack of crazy ideas from go to whoa. Not for lovers of fine cinema but for those who might enjoy the charms of a modern monster mash.,5
Hellboy,"This movie is getting slammed for no reason. For anyone who watched this expecting a super elabraote story - what did you honestly expect? Comics aside, this movie itself is a very entertaining action-packed comedy that my friends and I enjoyed from start to finish. If this movie interests you, stop reading other peoples' negative reviews and give it a try for yourself (that's what I did).",5
Hellboy,"I really like Hellboy, and liked this movie a lot. I also liked the Del Toro movies, but this movie is more similar to the comics. It has fun action and I enjoyed the ride. CGI wasn't great, but I didn't bother me too much.",5
Hellboy,"Loved the story. The way they go about making the characters this time had a very dark atmosphere loved the gore it's worth giving a chance it feels like there setting up for a much more expansive universe this time around and I would definitely recommend. I feel like most people will slam this movie because it's a movie from a lower budget studio that's trying to build themselves up....the score this time around was definitely geared for people that like rock
Hopefully this makes room for a bigger better sequel",5
Hellboy,"Ron Perlman would be very disappointed at the way people are treating this movie simply because it is not his and Del Toro's. I loved it. The comics are satanic bloody monster violence and that is what this movie is in a nutshell. You should just watch and enjoy it David, Mia, Ian, and the rest of the cast did a great job and put their heart into this. I'd go give it a watch if you are intrested.",5
Hellboy,"Whats wrong with all these critics !.This is a really good Hellboy movie with R rating !.Why so many people dislike it?.
Acting is really good.The story is also really good and unexpected !.
The action scene and gore wit R rating is so awesome to see in Big screen.
I think I preffer much more the new version of Hellboy movie R rating, than the old one with PG13 !.
On RottenTomatoes just 10 % really ?.What is wrong with all these critics I say.
I saw much more worse movies in my life , with 90 % on Rottentomatoes.So wtf is wrong with these all critics?.
I didnt like the trailer as everyone.I didnt expect to be even average after the trailer.I went to the cinema , and I saw a really good Hellboy movie with one of the best action scene I have ever seen.Really good story and acting.
I love the actor that play Hellboy.I recommend this movie.Dont listen all these critics.
I think people just dont like so much different ideas in new Hellboy movie with R rating, compare to the old one from Dell Torro which I also like it very much.
From me its 8\10.",5
Hellboy,"The flim is great I loved the r rating and was not much of a fan of the original movie but I was super hyped for this and it didn't disappoint, it's a great action horror comic I think everyone who like blood and gore should read a d think they should definitely see the flim.",5
Hellboy,"Loved it. Super fun movie that stays mostly true to the beloved source.Lot of fake reviews and self-important critics bashing because that's what bullies do.But you're not gonna listen to them are you? You can think for yourself, right?Was Del Torro/Perlman's Hellboy better? Maybe...Is this better than the rest of the cookie cutter snoozers out there? Most assuredly.10/10 to compensate for the storm troopers",5
Hellboy,Ok so I have now officially given up listening to critics........this movie is exactly like what I was expecting from the second trailer......a great fun comic book action movie and it introduced a great new direction for the character......I simply love David Harbour as Hellboy and yes I'm a big fan of the original movies too......but this felt like watching a graphic novel come to life like Watchmen did....Go and enjoy this movie!!!!!,5
Hellboy,"Don't listen the the bad reviews,just go and watch the movie and thanks me later.",5
Hellboy,"Although the effort of the director and the talent of the actors, the movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology. The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts.
The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided.
At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies.
My rating?
5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws.
Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it.
If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated.
See you next time at the movies,
Ruben the Critic",3
Hellboy,"Really don't understand the hate. This movie is funny, and entertaining through and through. I loved it. A lot better than DelToro's version. Go see it, have a good time and don't go in expecting to hate it. It's actually a pretty solid movie. I mean cmon, it's hellboy, what do you want?",5
Hellboy,"I don't understand the hate for this movie. Because of all the bad reviews I went into this thinking it was going to be horrible, but it's wasn't at all. Is it an Oscar winner? No! But not every movie has to be. I really enjoyed it and had a good time. A lot of the humor landed with me and the audience I was watching with. The gore was a BIT much, so know going into it that there are some pretty horrific scenes. David really shone as HellBoy. Overall a good movie!",5
Hellboy,I think the fact that everyone started slating this movie from its announcement hasnt helped it. Much more faithful to the graphic novels. No soppy love story. Just action!,5
Hellboy,"Now I never really write reviews for anything. But with all the bad reviews this has been getting I felt the need to come to it's defence.This film is actually fantastic.
So first off, STOP COMPARING THIS TO DEL TOROS WORK. Del Toro did not invent hellboy. He simply adapted the source material with his own spin. Don't get me wrong, I love the orginal two...BUT, all these negative reviews by people who are determined to hate it because of the Del toro movies is downright childish to be quite honest.Second, Harbour does a bloody fantastic job of bringing hellboy to life. While still not exactly the same as the comic hellboy, his damn close, way more so than Ron Perlmen.Now as a longstanding mega fan of the comics I can safely say this was made for the fans. It has so many utterly satisfying scenes, nods, characters and scenarios, subtle and not so subtle ripped straight from the comics. So if you're a fan of the comics , you will get that little extra bit of satsifaction.I was thoroughly entertained as both a fan and a movie goer.
If you dont go in expecting a oscar winning masterpiece. You're in a for one incredibly entertaining, gore filled, epic quest of a movie. Filled with silly humour, epic fights, actually good cgi and more monster than you can shake a big red fist at.Don't listen to the hate..GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",5
Hellboy,"A good movie, a bad movie. I felt somehow that I should choose a side - or Del Toro's adaptation or this one. Well - I like both. This one is gory - but this is what Hellboy's world build by Mike looks like.Here is my opinion:
1. I read the reviews - both positive and negative.
2. I went to see it and to decide for myself.
3. I like it. Most of it - Baba Yaga part.It was wow - everything - character design, environment, performance, CGI.... It was ... different, scary but absolutely love it. I don't know how to explain it well without spoilers. You should see this on a big screen, guys.",5
Hellboy,Just because Del Toro isnt directing and Hellboy isnt Perlman doesnt mean this film should be getting slammed unfairly the way it is. it's a new vision and adaptation that actually works even better as far as following comic source material. The action and pacing is intense and the horror aspects are really well blended. People keep slandering the cgi and honestly its excellent cgi. The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well. Just see this and pay no mind to delusional biased critics and haters. It's a fun adaptation.,5
Hellboy,The movie is all a Hellboy movie should be. I really don't understand the hate towards it. Really refreshing stuff and much better then previous movies. 10/10 in my book.,5
Hellboy,"This was a good movie, most of the hate I see on this movie, is it's not Ron or Del toro... to be straight it was better without either of them Hellboy is not ment to be PG-13 love story, theres blood and gore monsters and demons. The CGI is not great and jumped a bit but overall it was good I'd watch it again in the theater, people need to stop paying so much attention to critics and make there own opinions after they watch the movie. Don't just not watch it cause Ron Perlman wasn't in it or Del Toro didn't direct or cause some over paid critic who really only likes drama & love stories said it was bad.",5
Hellboy,"I was biased since I enjoyed the original movies however once it developed all hesitation went away.
Different take and in my opinion closer to the comics. Did not expect the darkness and humor to transfer so well but it did.
If you're a hellboy fan go see it.
If you're not be prepared for more depth than the original on struggle with inner darkness.",5
Hellboy,"Non-stop action. Heavy Harbour. Horror. Maleficent Milla. Monsters. Diamond Dae Kim. Darkness. Charming Haden Church. Gore! This movie is an absolute fun to watch. Forget about the R-rating and leave the previous Hellboy movies to rest in peace. Harbour's Hellboy has his own face, voice, jokes and hellish attitude. He owns both worlds - down below and right here. You will love him! A new cult movie was born tonight!",5
Khananam,"I saw this with my family in a theatre. Superb film.
Found the movie to b a bit drag at times. No overacting by Srk this time. I ain't no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance.
If you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than ""copycat BARFI"" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.",5
Khananam,"As a middle school teacher, I think there aren't many better movies for showing how 9/11 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad, and it is definitely not flag waving, but it tackles real issues, and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very, very popular in South Asia, Africa, and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions, and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama, this is not it. If you want a window in to how the rest of the world lives, views America, and how they sometimes feel left out, this is it. I have yet to have a parent, a student, or a fellow teacher watch it and say, ""blah"".",5
Khananam,"My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date - powerful, moving and involving. Johar seemed to have learnt a lot from the previous feedbacks he must have got for his films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija, who finally proves her talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly realistic and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places, but it never goes over-the-top and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic, which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. All these antonyms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This was really tough viewing.That's where our hero, Rizwan Khan, is thrown. He suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, he's different, he's naive, he takes every word literally, but he is intelligent and talented, and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him: the world includes only two groups of people  good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always, and it's easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is amazing. His relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him, is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour, romance and some wonderful songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as ""Sajda"", ""Noor-E-Khuda"" and ""Tera Naina Re"". The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lip-sync in a true Hindi film style, is appreciable but I, for one, at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from Johar's previous films, the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much more simple, light and enjoyable. The later half introduces the post-9/11 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is brilliantly done. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist, and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself.Khan's journey in the US is extraordinary. It unfolds in several episodes, each one presenting the different people he meets on his way: a motel owner named Jitesh, a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food, a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode, however, is that of Mama Jenny and her son 'Funny Hair' Joel from the rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is incredibly entertaining and heart-touching. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving, and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing ""We Shall Overcome"" is one of my favourite scenes in the film. That was unforgettable.Well, there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of many discussions, and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his finest performances. He is phenomenal. It's amazing to see him transforming from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and playing it with such conviction. His mannerisms, body language, tone, dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing.As expected, he is totally matched by Kajol, whose charismatic nature, easy charm, evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity, maturity and strength. As Mandira, she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural, intense and compelling as ever, playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No, I'm not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes (which are great), but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It's one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor, no matter how lengthy his character is, performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan's caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan's brother Zakeer, who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother's mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer's wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira's friend, Sarah. Tanay Chheda is first-rate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up, My Name is Khan is a fantastic film and an altogether worthy effort. It is fascinating, entertaining and it may definitely make you look at certain things differently. It is well written, directed and performed, and is beautifully shot. Deepa Bhatia's editing and Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography are also noteworthy. Kudos to all involved. Mr and Mrs Khan rock, I highly recommend you to see their story.",5
Khananam,"This movie I got to say is the most endearing & has some superb performances from Shahrukh and Kajol.It is undoubtedly one of the most moving & meaningful movies which has been spurned out from Bollywood.Moving away from all stereotyped roles,acting,storyline, this movie places its flag of its own.All credits to Karan Johar for telling such a complex subject in such simple words.Brilliant cinematography,direction & performance makes this film worth watching not one but many times.The characters stay with you for a long time even after you leave the theater.SRK is Awesome in his acting along with Kajol supporting her character brilliantly.SRK never for once loses his grip on the character despite playing a patient of Asperger Syndrome which is one of the most challenging role played by any Indian actor or any Hollywood actor like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.Go Watch this Soul-Tearing movie which forces you to re-think about the myths of religion,classes,communities & genders in which the human beings are classified every now & then.All this along with entertaining you all the way with some very cute funny scenes.Take the message from this movie & pass it along to everybody.This is what this movie deserves. A Gr8 movie.Must watch. 10/10.",5
Khananam,"IF you believe that you have seen the best of srk think again. This movie will rock your world upside down and it will make you wonder how come an actor can make you fall in love with him every time he perform in a movie. the story, full staff of the movie every thing to the smallest details has been crafted as an unforgettable master piece that will live in the hearts and thoughts of audience for years and years to come. srk has raised the bar again giving all other actors and film makers a level that is hard to reach.As for the movie and the story i believe the best thing to do is for you to just watch it. personally when i got out of the movie theater i felt like to buy another ticket and get back to see it again that's how attached and obsessed i came with this movie. if you want your life to be rocked go see it.",5
Khananam,"Mandira tells Rizwan she'll buy 6 hair products from him but he tells her he'll only sell her four because the remaining two will go to waste. He may be the world's worst salesman but he's the best human being. This is Rizwan, an innocent, clean hearted, simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world; those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn't stupid, in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won't bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Mandira (Kajol). However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you'll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the Rizwan-Mandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous ""young"" love stories but he is even better in this mature, realistic portrayal of ""love at first sight"". He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit, the second half begins to become more far-fetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography, you've got to give it to Ravi K Chandran, the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye, were not over-powering and used simply as a back-drop. Coming onto the extras, I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once, these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless, they are relatively unknown actors (apart from Jimmy Shergill) and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heart-felt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He's done it all and yet he can still leave us gob-smacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard- ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan's loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy, you feel happy; when he is sad, you feel sad; when he is hurt, you feel hurt; and when he is confused and lost, you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice, you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I'm so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had, periodGo watch this film now and I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that. I myself am going to go watch it a few more times and I can't wait!",5
Khananam,I just returned home after the screening of MNIK and i had a blast! I just thought i should share my experience with all of you so here it goes...First things first it ain't a typical bollywood masala flick! It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!This movie deserves a full 10!!Thanks and Regards!,5
Khananam,"This movie has such an important theme and had a huge impact on me. In this part of the world, religious intolerance is evident, especially with the minority I can from. America needs to KNOW that not all Muslims/Arabs are terrorist. You claim religious tolerance and indifference when in fact you are blinded by your own grief and misjudgment. Please let this movie change that, and become an eye-opener not only to cultural and religious tolerance in the US but all around the world, including in Egypt. The main idea is reiterated in the movie over and over again - there are only good people and bad people - there is no other difference. Brilliant movie!",5
Khananam,"There are only two kind of people in the world:GOOD people who do good things and BAD people who do bad things.In this world where the definitions of good and bad are changing everyday by those who are in power and those who want the power, most of us just go with the flow and believe the values which are most convenient to us.But there exist some people who are gifted(or cursed;depends on your point of view) to see things as they are without their interests hindering the view of their souls. One such soul belongs to the protagonist of this movie who will touch your heart for sure.Without giving any details and spoiling your experience I would like u to go and watch this movie without presuming anything.I am not saying that it is without flaws:you may find the lead actress a bit too shrill at times, the editing a bit finer and the background score too loud in two or three scenes but watch this movie for its intent and its message that there is nothing in this world which holds as much power as an emotion:LOVE.",5
Khananam,"This is one of the best Bollywood movie I've seen so far. MNIK is awesome. Its a must watch for every human being. Its a movie for humanity. The way Shahrukh Khan has projected himself as an autistic patient is just awesome. Kudos to him. This is by far his best acting. After this movie, he has proved why he is called The King of Bollywood. He is in a league of his own. No one is even close to him. I have loved the movie. You will not be able to take away your eyes for a single minute in this 160mins movie. This is just fabulous. Kajol as Mandira was awesome too. She had played an excellent character and supported SRK very well. Their chemistry is to die for. Few moments in the movie will make you cry. The way he goes to an only Christian event and donates the money and says ""Take this money for the Africans who are not Christians, darling"" is awesome. This movie will be an all-time blockbuster. Go and Watch this movie !!",5
Khananam,"Welcome to a new world: Rizwan's world! There is no religion in his world only good people and bad people! He suffers from a form of autism; asperger's syndrome but that doesn't stop him from differentiating between good and bad and mind you he is a genius and has a pretty good memory.. He doesn't hesitate in saying the truth and is always ready to help and love others.. He says the Khans don't break their promise! He hates yellow color and says the use of mobile phone will kill bees and eventually human beings!This movie isn't a copy of New York or Kurbaan as people say.. In fact this is the only movie in recent times with a super strong message.. The music is soulful and gels along with the movie very well.. Cinematography is top notch! Hats off to Karan Johar for his marvelous direction and special accolades must be given to Shibani Bhatija for superb dialogues! But the man who deserves special kudos and a standing ovation is the king khan himself!! Forget Chak de! Forget Swades or forget anything you remember about him!! The moment you are out of the hall you wont be able to think SRK as a normal person... Funny but yeah he has acted so beautifully that you will only remember Shah Rukh as Rizwan! Yes Rizwan is his new name now!! Kajol was also good in her role even though she doesn't have a big role in the movie! Her sizzling chemistry with SRK is visible whenever the duo are together on screen.. specially in the song Tere Naina!He doesn't care what problem is he in or how famous he has become by doing those deeds which every human being should do! He only cares about a promise that he has to carry out in order to rebuild his shattered dreams of a successful life.. He loves Mandira(Kajol) and her son very much and he is ready to do anything for them!! He never forgets anyone who helped him! All he wants is peace in the world and for every human being!!SRK is back with a bang!! My Name Is Khan will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you fall in love with Khan!! So please take my advice watch the movie as soon as possible!! My Rating 10/10Thanks and Regards!",5
Khananam,"Just back from the Mumbai Fox office after watching portions of the final edit of My Name is Khan. Fox guys were really keen whether the $16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan, he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie, and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker, Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay, and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America, and as I already mentioned, if marketed properly, this one has potential to gross $20-30 million in North America alone. Having said that, being primarily a love story, it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years, the hype in India is inexplicable. Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10 rating, and advise everyone to celebrate Valentine's with KHAN.",0
Khananam,"Karan's take on the issue deserves the highest praise, since a subject like this is difficult to attempt. Final word? MY NAME IS KHAN is Karan, SRK and Kajol's best outing to date. Do I need to add anything more?A number of sequences are endearing. For instance, the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle, yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst  first, when her son meets with a catastrophe and second, when she confronts SRK  are truly shattering.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heard/read/watched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also, the movie states  and states very strongly, without mincing words  Not all Muslims are terrorists.There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction  exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation, he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind. With MY NAME IS KHAN, Karan takes rapid strides as a storyteller.On the whole, MY NAME IS KHAN is a fascinating love story, has an angle of religion and a world-shaking incident as a backdrop. It not only entertains, but also mesmerises, enthrals and captivates the viewer in those 2.40 hours. At the same time, a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a far-reaching influence due to its noble theme...MUST WATCH!!!",5
Khananam,"I was able to see the first screening of MNIK. With a lot on Karan Johar and Shahrukh Khan's shoulders, I must say the film exceeds all expectations and My Name Is Khan will deliver internationally. Shahrukh Khan known for his commercial romantic roles steps outside his boundary with My Name Is Khan and delivers a magnificent performance. Opposite him you have Kajol who matches Shahrukh Khan step by step. Direction, editing and visuals are all A rate. Not sure who gets credited for the story; Shibani or Karan. My Name Is Khan should lead Bollywood to international fame. All we need to do now is wait for February 2010.",0
Khananam,"The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious, perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding, love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan, first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability, then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons, one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim, which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched, they only find the things he needs for his journey, identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his, although limited in some sense, understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of Hindu/Muslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life, with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister in-law who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina, this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character, beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie; the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad, no Hindu and Muslim, no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists, good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim, bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women, good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition, such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center, the wife of his brother who teaches at a college, the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan, first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources. I gained a better understanding of why in fact the Muslim faith tradition is one of love, from Khan quoting directly from the two religious books the Hadith and the Qur'an in order to reinforce the love he showed to everyone. As a further demonstration there is the scene where he travels to Wilhelmina Georgia in order to be with and help save Mama Jenny and Funny Haired Joel.",4
Khananam,delivers everything with simplicity... a standing ovation to SRK for the way he has acted a movie which delivers a message that humanity is everything and not religion....... people should not be judged by their religion....and u can't just stop loving Rizwan KHAN(not SRK) he has done such a wonderful work u will get lost in him....it is undoubtedly one of the finest movies to come out of Bellwood in recent years....and not only SRK everyone has done excellent work in this movie....you cannot miss the SRK-KAJOL chemistry it's so refreshing to see them together again....everyone can take it as a valentine gift....music is very good it takes the story forward and not like other Bellwood flicks in which songs are added forcefully... so in my view it's an awesome movie which is honest and simple in every aspects...,5
Khananam,"Some love stories are built on passion, some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey. My Name Is Khan introduces us to the world of Rizwan Khan, who mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal, but his vulnerability which makes him endear-able. The audience falls in love with Rizwan because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey, that you no longer root for SRK and his victory, but for Rizwan and his belief, which makes My Name Is Khan a winner right from the opening credits.His name is Khan, Rizwan Khan. Brought up in an unforgiving society, Rizwan battles the alternate evils of racial profile and scornful peers with equal focus, trying to make sense of the world that burns homes, bullies people at school and make a false show of sympathy. He goes by the doctrine of his Ammi, who teaches him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Rizwan carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.My Name Is Khan is appreciable because of its brilliance, acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Karan Johar weaves in a tale of love, faith, religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 160 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system, through the filtered sensibilities of a patient suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, one who cannot understand the world, but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Rizwan, Karan succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.The story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film, constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising, casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Shibani Bathija is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Rizwan through his smiles and tears , laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Bollywood.In the end, My Name Is Khan becomes the experience it is because of Rizwan and Mandira, essayed flawlessly by Shahrukh and Kajol. Shahrukh exudes the spirit of Rizwan in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Rizwan , who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by Kajol whose very presence lights up the entire room with just a flashing smile. She balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Shahrukh and Kajol form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jimmy Shergil as Shahrukh's brother delivers a matured and restrained performance while Zarina Waheb as Rizwan's mother blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Tanay Chheda is exceptional as the young Rizwan in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Vinay Pathak in a dazzling cameo.There will always be movies that enchant us with their magic, but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. My Name Is Khan is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will never be one Rizwan Khan, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events. After 12th February 2010, the scales of humanity would mark the world before and after the release of My Name Is Khan.My Rating- 5/5 (Exceptional!!)",5
Khananam,"Well,SRK is sure going to win a award for MNIK... his best acting so far & Kajol she is the best pair for SRK ... they have a great chemistry on screen i am sure they are the best in bollywood.SEL Music .. is like a slow poison .. one may not like it immediately as you hear those numbers again & again there is kind of Addiction .. ultra melodious song Mark my words, dis ain't an other BOLLYWOOD (masala) flick, all the songs are background .. Karan johar hats of for making such a Master piece ..Tribute to all the LOvers across the Globe ,. its LOVE & all about Love.",5
Khananam,"My Name Is Khan is yet another film that will put the Indian film industry on the map. And this is a new phenomenon that America will have to get used to, foreign film countries shooting in the USA and examining our society. For better or worse this is how we seem to many foreigners.Shakrukh Khan creates a character in Rizwan Khan that many Americans will recognize if they've seen Being There, Rainman, and Forrest Gump. Bits from all those films will be found in My Name Is Khan. Khan is a Moslem citizen of India who emigrates to the USA and finds love and happiness when he weds a mother with a son from a previous marriage the wife played by Kajol and the stepson by Yurgon Makaar. She's Hindu, but the different faiths don't seem to matter. Khan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and its challenge enough for him to make his way in the world without picking up on the subtle nuances of the differences of religions and why one group has to hate all the others.All this changes on September 11, 2001 when some fanatical Moslems hijack some airlines and change the course of history forever crashing them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and killing a lot of innocent people, including a few hundred Moslems by all counts of the victims. As in the past here and other places bad behavior by some inflicted a stigma on the group.Young Mr. Makaar is killed in a hate crime incident which changes Khan's relationship with his mother and Khan himself through a combination of circumstances gets on a terrorist watch list. Khan conceives a mission to tell the President of the United States be it George W. Bush or Barack Obama that he is not a terrorist. Both in my professional and family heritage I've got some history with these kind of events. In my former job with Crime Victims Board I had a claim involving a bias attack against a young Arab American boy the same age as Mr. Makaar. It was only when I questioned the young man and his parents I learned of the bias nature of the events. Together with the GLBT liaison with the Kings County District Attorney we went to the Bias Unit of the NYPD and got the case reclassified as a bias attack. Sad though that no one was ever arrested for the crime, but it wasn't for lack of trying here. This was during the years immediately following the first Iraqi War and there was an upswing of attacks on Moslem Americans then as well.After World War I, we had the Palmer Raids in which the Bill of Rights was torn up and under the Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer many suspected radicals of Jewish or Slavic origins were deported in wholesale lots. I had a grand uncle on my mother's side who had such radical politics and he missed being deported by a hair. This was after the Russian Revolution and a number of anarchist bombings including the Morgan Bank on Wall Street and a mail bomb sent to the Attorney General himself. Duly elected Socialist members of the New York State Legislature were expelled at this time. It was not a good era.In the tradition of Peter Sellers, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks, Shahrukh Khan might have an Oscar or nomination at least in his future. Two Magic Kingdom regulars from their teen shows have parts in this, Shane Harper of Good Luck Charlie plays one of the bashers and and Kenton Duty of Shake It Up playing the best friend who turns on Yurgon Makaar show far more acting chops in this than on the Disney Channel.There is no excuse or reason, no justification at all to make war on children. If you want to fight terrorists there's a war now in Afghanistan and probably future wars for the USA unless both we get it right and certain Moslems realize they are not taking the world over for Allah. Ditto the Christians who want to win the world for Jesus. We all have to live together and secular humanism may yet save us all.And this review is dedicated to the late Liz Garro of the Kings County District Attorney's office, the late John Lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived in the USA until his 90s, and to Ziad Abdel-Dayem of Brooklyn who last I heard is a married man. All three of you made the world a better place.",5
Khananam,"it has been 2 years since i seen this movie, i've been writing reviews lately so i wanted to review this movie also one of the best movies of all times where do i begin we are made enemies of each other we see a group of people but not the individual this movie shows u a glimpse of what we Muslim felt i cannot tell u the movie u have to watch it to understand the journey of khan from his hometown to America his journey to America u have to watch him sell love an loose his loved ones his despair to be ""as his mother said ""khan there are 2 kinds of people on this earth good people and bad people"" ""his journey to find the president to tell him that HIS NAME IS KHAN AND HE IS NOT A TERRORIST"" after seeing this movie my heart cried out and i wanted to see the movie again for people who loved the blind side of sandra Bullock remember the titans i recommanded if u are full of hate u might watch it to to get some insight about people u do not know",5
Khananam,"This is a great three hour movie and every minute of it is a gem, so be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster. An Indian film taken and set in America but more Hollywood than bollywood but nonetheless this is a truly International film and you will definitely enjoy it and want to watch it again.It really does entertain, there is comedy and drama, melodramatic in excess at times, like with the church scene in Wilhemina with mama jenny, but who cares, the film is a movie not a documentary.reminds me very slightly of Tom Hanks situation in Terminal but more so with the Kite Runner than Slumdog Millionaire and of course Rain Man with the Autism factor.Confused about the timeline because 11 September happened of course in 2001 but the story appears set in 2007. And who was the funeral for which the two boys, Samier and white boy. Did something happen to the other boys Father which triggered the conversation and unease between the two Mothers? Mystified why Shahrukh Khan, who was the main character of the movie, is not shown in the film credits by IMDb? others have made comment about this.A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than Slumdog and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.More films like this please! Less political overtone perhaps but never mind the melodrama, have the tissues at the ready!",5
Khananam,"i saw the screening of my name is khan its a great movie with strong message about humanity , pure love , terrific performance by sharukh like DEVDAS, CHAKDE, SWADESH I think he will cross all bar here and reach a next level of acting kajol is also acting wonderfully both are too cute in movie lots of emotional love moments die for , the movie will give no chance to be bored it will take you to next level dram too good performance here sharukg wil get another award break record of dilip kumar here i think so , the 2half of movie is turning point you can not sit in the chair we all stand and give a clapping to this movie for great achievement , kajol also good but sharukh extraordinary performance here altogether nobody can imagine he will deserve here national award please watch biggest blockbuster of 2010 might it will cross all the record",0
Khananam,"MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie. At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important. Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'. As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels. The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact. We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad. Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill). One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan. Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected. When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.' Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found. Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe. There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet. Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll. Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol. Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth! Grady Harp",5
Khananam,"""My Name is Khan"" is Shahrukh Khan, Kajol and Karan Johar's best movie ever released... Movie mirrors our current era, as the it used the criterion of 9/11 Terror Attacks and shows how Muslims are discriminated in U.S. As Directed by the only finest and the best storyteller ""KARAN JOHAR"" who earlier made ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai(1998)"", ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham(2001)"", ""Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna(2006)"" and now ""My Name is Khan(2010)"" is surely the best of all.My Name is Khan is a fascinating movie with Excellent Story and Music being directed by the Best Director Karan Johar, surely deserves an Award. For me movie is 10 on 10, it's a must watch therefore i'll 'say go for it'.",5
Khanana,"Sha-Na-Na was a syndicated musical variety show which of course centered on the music group Sha Na Na who were well known for recreations of 50s and 60s classics. The jokes and skits were often pathetic but the music was pretty good and the band members (all ten of them) always seemed to be having a good time. They never took themselves too seriously and weren't above making fun of themselves. Bowzer was the leader and always closed the show by going ""Do-Do-Do-Do"" over and over while making muscles, which was a joke as he was pretty skinny and barely had any muscle. The guests were often from the 50s/60s era but once in awhile, they had more current guests like the Ramones and Kim Carnes. A show like this would never be made today, even with contemporary music stars but looking back, Sha Na Na was pretty fun to watch.",0
Khanana,"Sha Na Na were a group of Columbia University students who formed in 1968 and rose to popularity after performing at Woodstock, but it was their appearance in the blockbuster success GREASE that led to the creation of this variety show built around the band. The comedy sketches performed by the band were all based in a 50's ""West Side Story"" reality (on a sound stage) and in front of an ""almost live"" audience. Likely formulated to cash in on the 50's revival movement begun with American GRAFITI and HAPPY DAYS, it's perhaps surprising that it lasted as long as it did -a brief three and a half seasons. It may not have been as professional as Donnie & Marie or even the Mandrell Sisters, but what it lacked in budget it more than made up for in chutzpah. The ""greaser"" styled ensemble did a fair job on the comedy, which clicked mostly with youngsters, but the real highlight of this regional weekly program was the music., which appealed to older audiences nostalgic for the uncomplicated rock 'n roll music of the 50s.The band always performed at least one song in a straight-forward live manner, and usually several other songs throughout the program during the comedy vignettes (ala the Monkees). The writing was simple (perhaps even juvenile) but entertaining, as the program's target audience was probably also watching the (superior) Muppet Show, and the (inferior) Hudson Brothers, and Sha Na Na fit neatly between the two in terms of quality, and provided an alternative to the nursing home muzak of Lawrence Welk. The breakout star of the group was Jon ""Bowzer"" Bauman, whose basso profondo vocal register was so low as to be a novelty in and of itself. He went on to numerous acting roles and game show gigs. The television show helped the band sell a handful of records, and bushels of live concert tickets throughout its late 70's / early 80's run. For better or worse, Sha Na Na served as a cultural bridge for the generation between the New York Dolls (with whom they shared the Filmore East stage on more than one occasion) and new wave; it's hard to imagine the success of rockabilly revivalists The Stray Cats, without giving a little credit to the relentlessly touring Sha Na Na. All in all, it was good clean fun for the whole family -a sort of doo-wop version of HEE HAW.",0
Khanana,"I loved this show and I always will.I refuse to die before I get the episodes on DVD, especially the one where the Ramones guest star. Oh man, how frickin' cool is that. One thing that is rarely mentioned in rock trivia is the fact that SHa Na Na, of all bands, influenced punk rock, even today you can hear the style of what they did in pop-punk. Essentially, the took a standard song and sped it up and that's what the Ramones did (and they all dressed like Bowzer haha!!!) OK, so they really influenced me.They had some really fine original songs too, in addition to the re-vamped oldies, and since they were 'hippies' and spoke ill of president Nixon *gasp* they will always be cool, as long as war and hatred rage across this planet. This fact makes my Sha Na Na cover band, Baa Na Na (started way back when I was too young to see the irony) something I will be forever proud of.Grease for Peace!! (more than ever)",5
Khanana,"I started watching this show as a kid . Bowzer was my all-time favorite with his wacky attitude, and Johnny was cute:-) The 10 guys were really wonderful with all their songs & that lady that heckled the guys from her window was pretty funny.Soupy Sales starred on the show starting in Season 3 as both Officer Fussy & ""Armond Fussy Director of Greaser Hall"" (Sadly in 1988 Dave ""Chico"" Ryan passed away.""Dirty""Dan McBride joined Chico in 2009. Denny passed away in 2015 R.I.P Chico Danny & Denny. )Their guests ranged from singers that sang in the 50s (like the Crystals) to comedians (like Henny Youngman & Billy Crystal) & even a few country singers (like Barbara Mandrell.Bowzer guest starred on her show some time later.) Grease for peace!",5
Khanana,"With ever episode of Sha Na Na, we laughed a little, learned a little, and sang a little. Admittedly, I was like five years old when I saw this show on TV, but I thought it was, as they say ""wicked awesome."" They should release this on DVD for sure.",0
Khanana,"I was never a huge fan of 50's rock, but I still couldn't help liking this show.This was like every other comedy ensemble. Putting the greaser rock songs in and having guest stars from the same era helped a lot. You always wondered which lost classic they'd cover next. And putting comedy into the performances was great too.Of course Bowzer pretty much owned this show. It would not have worked without him. Some of his humor sounded ad-libbed too. The guy was a trip.Other favorite were Big Lenny (Why do the big guys always have the high tenors?) and Santini. (Great deadpan from him.) Great show.",5
Khanana,"This was a great show. We loved watching the 50's come alive each week as the band brought back some of the greatest music ever made. Sha Na Na was the GREATEST tribute band ever assembled because they didn't just salute a single band- they saluted an entire decade of music! Boy, just think of the great music of the 50's, with so many great songs! That's what Sha Na Na meant to so many of us- they were our connection to the music of the 50's. There was such personality to the band- and Bowzer was the ""leader of the pack."" He had a great way of making each show so much fun. Sha Na Na is still touring and I'd recommend seeing them as a fun way to see what music used to be like- FUN!",5
Khanana,"How odd it is that some people still think that Sha Na Na emerged and made their mark on the movie GREASE which later led to this short lived variety show.Before GREASE (1978), HAPPY DAYS (1974) and American Graffiti (1973), there was Sha Na Na, who formed in 1968 and played in Woodstock in 1969. They also had a slew of singles and 3 albums to their credit before their label (Kama Sutra) released THE GOLDEN AGE OF ROCK 'N' ROLL on a 2-album set in 1973.Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids may had appeared on American Graffiti and in 1975 as Fish & the Fins on HAPPY DAYS. But they got there by pretty much copying the style of Sha Na Na! While I was not too wild about variety shows nor was I too wild about acts that would lipsinque, Sha Na Na were the exception to the rule. Their blend of comedy and music made their variety show a hit with their fan base, which also included us critics out there on the fringe, drawn to their brand of entertainment, like a moth to a light. Even my mother, whose teenage years were spent during the ""big band era"" (and not a fan of rock & roll) enjoyed this show.One classic performance was a version of ""A Lover's Question"" (by Clyde McPhatter-1958/Atlantic Records). The setting looked like something out of THE WEST SIDE STORY. And each of the members was sitting on a window sill or on a fire escape! Classic rock 'n' roll as we like to remember it! Grease for peace!!!",4
Khanana,"LIKE MOST ROCK Music groups, the gravitation toward comedy was a force that couldn't be resisted. The emotional expressing of what the moods and lyrics of a particular piece of music require a great deal of acting. No singer wishes to just sing the words alone.ADDED TO THIS, we have the costuming and stage personality which gets superimposed over the real person. The result is entertainers whose on stage presentation lampoons the real world in a sort of cartoony style.HENCE, WE HAVE the phenomenon of the Comedian-Rocker; of which we can't think of a better example than our honored group of the day, SHA NA NA.OUR RECOLLECTIONS OF this series are ones of the great and the nostalgic. Being a syndicated series, it was no doubt seen at different times in the various markets that featured it. In our case, it was on the NBC wholly owned subsidiary, WMAQ, Channel 5. We remember that it played late on Saturday following NBC's Saturday NIGHT LIVE.EVERY PROGRAM FEATURED power names from show biz in the special guest spotlight. Singers, Comedians and Legendary performers galore headed up the weekly proceedings. Being that they were limited to a 30 minute length and format, things went surprisingly well. We had wished that SHA NA NA would have had a full hour with which to work; but alas, It wasn't to be.THE GROUP'S CHOSEN image, being that of a bunch of street toughs, led by Jon ""Bowser"" Baumann, proved to be a really misleading facade. In actuality, this conglomeration of dyed in the wool ""Greasers"" were a truly a talented musical team. And, they were really much more than the series revealed. We saw them in concert at the Holiday Star Theatre, Merrillville, Indiana, circa 1982. THeir show was excellent, believe us.AS FOR THEIR leader, ""Bowser""; it turns out that Jon Baumann was voice-trained on the Classics. You know what that means, don't you Schultz? Yeah,it's like Opera!",3
Khanana,"I remember watching Sha Na Na in the late 70s and early 80s and to me it was a nostalgic romp back to the 50s and 60s as the group led by Jon (Bowzer) Bauman performed classic hits from rock and roll's early days. Even though they portrayed greasers, in real life, they were very bright fellows who graduated from Columbia University and they had a great time doing what they did.But they also proved that they can do comedy and they pulled it off well as they were backed by regulars Pamela Myers and Jane Dulo, who also portrayed the crabby neighbor. Later in the show's run, Soupy Sales joined the cast as a policeman.Celebrity guests also appeared on the show and they added to the fun and nostalgia of the show, which was set in an area my dad grew up in, The Bronx.It's a shame Sha Na Na hasn't been rerun in years or released on DVD. It probably has to do with music licensing issues. But it brings back memories of early rock and roll and Bowzer's deep bass voice. Let's not forget the big, bearded saxophone player Lennie Baker. Grease for peace.",0
Khanana,"A bunch of never-weres from the fifties dug back up to make a boring, poorly-written show in the seventies. The leader had a dog's name. They were obviously on a sound stage. They were nowhere near as funny as they thought they were. Its dumbness was only comparable to the ""Brady Bunch Hour."" It was very adolescent. I tried to avoid it, but my little brothers had to have it on sometimes.",2
Jalsaghar,"At the time I post this, only 123 people have cast a vote of any kind for The Music Room.  What a shame.Satyajit Ray is one of the greatest directors of all-time and The Music Room is his masterpiece.  Correction: The Music Room is a masterpiece of world cinema.How to describe this movie?  In Hollywood lingo, you could call it Citizen Kane meets Black Narcissus with a big dose of King Lear.  Of course, if you called it that, they'd shelve the project and spend the money on the sequel to XXX.Pity poor Biswambhar Roy, a king in a lonely castle.  He's lost not only his family but his entire way of life.  He is a mistake.  A forgotten man waiting in his empty shell of a world.He spends the last remnants of his once vast fortune on a final, lavish musical performance in his crumbling home, a last-ditch attempt to connect to the pride and joy he once felt in his life.Not that he is innocent.  He is proud and oblivious, spoiled and selfish. But surely not a bad man.  Merely a displaced man.  So we can cheer as he is granted one last moment of happiness and weep for him as he meets his inevitable end.How is that Satyajit Ray remains unknown even to many die-hard cineastes in the States?  I hope one of the companies will come along soon and release some of his work on DVD.",5
Jalsaghar,"WARNING -- PLOT DISCUSSED -- The jalsaghar is a great music hall in the mansion of the main character, a scion of a great landowning family. It's almost all he has left of the Ray family's legacy. Over the years his land has been slowly eaten away by one of the great rivers of Bengal. But he still has the trappings of aristocracy -- his retainers address him as ""Hujur"" (""my lord""); even his wealthy neighbour, Ganguli, addresses him as ""Thakurda"" (""(paternal) grandfather""). He lives only for his jalsaghar, where he can recreate his family's past glory and where he can still win a game of one-upmanship against Ganguli. Meanwhile, Ganguli is up-and-coming. He's a businessman, the new aristocrat, land-poor but cash-rich. He gets electric lights for his house; he gets a motor car, the first in the region. Satyajit Ray, the legendary director, masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas, a legend of the Calcutta stage. (An interesting aside -- ""chhabi"" is Bengali for ""picture"" and ""biswas"" means ""belief."") He fit the mold of a classic actor -- temperamental, undependable, a raging alcoholic, a master. Almost every scene is wholly dependent on him, as he preens and boasts and rages and pines away for lost glory. When you read that Biswas was in real life completely tone-deaf, his creation of a music-lover is an astonishing accomplishment, both by him and by Satyajit Ray.",0
Jalsaghar,"The Music Room is my favorite S. Ray film, and I came around to seeing it very late in the game. I do not hesitate when I say that it is perfect, and contains the single greatest musical number ever set to film. It amazes me when I pop in a picture made 50 years ago and learn so much from it, and am moved and shocked and carried by its honest emotions in a way that makes the Music Room feel so modern. It is now available in a tremendous Criterion version, so there should be no excuse on the part of cinephiles to miss this film. I introduce it to as many people as I can, and I consider it an act of kindness paid forward.",5
Jalsaghar,"Just to appreciate Roshan Kumari's legendary performance -one of the most mesmerizing dancing sequences ever filmed, this masterpiece deserves a repeated viewing. There is something savage, auto-destructive but also the purest in form about the landlord's passion for music and childish vanity in front of his peers, which made me ponder over the place of music in our society long after the credits end. In the age of MTV and MP3, we are used to the idea of carrying routinely our favorite songs everywhere from streets to bathroom, and it's pity that we hardly experience anymore the authentic ambiance of intimate music gathering such as miraculously acted and filmed in Jalsaghar. Music in other era and other place must have been high point and extra-ordinary moment of community life, source of the spiritual inspiration for civil life as well as its destruction. The decor and lighting of the music room is sumptuous and otherworldly, in perfect contrast with the wearisome monotony of domestic scenes the declining aristocrat is forced to endure.",5
Jalsaghar,"Jalsaghar (aka ""The Music Room"") is a 1958 drama film directed by master Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the pre-independence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindarsa dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur's glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray's fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijitothe finally film in Ray's much acclaimed ""The Apu Trilogy"". Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film, based on some popular work of literature, which would incorporate popular Indian music. But, what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an art-house work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian box-office. But, it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie's dark and gloomy tone. The movie's melancholic musical composition and sombre art directionthe sublime use of mirrors, chandeliers, etc.gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American Film-Noir films of the '40s and '50s.In Jalsaghar, Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that, having stood the test of time for over five decades, continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray's most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray's oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray's films, especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But, a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thought-provoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema. Jalsaghar.is an essential watch for all Satyajit Ray fans as well as those who understand and appreciate intelligent cinema. 10/10A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",5
Jalsaghar,"The film is a masterpiece, a definite 10.  As with the Apu trilogy, I am mesmerized and absorbed by the pacing and drama of the film. Even though the film uses music, its appreciation, and its status as the vehicle for its themes, there is no (or very little?) background music for the spoken portions of the film.  This provides not only realism, but sets off the intense and magnificent performance of the protagonist.  There is also a great deal of entertainment in this film: the music performances are excellent.  I wonder if Ray found the best musicians of the region and gave them roles as performers in the musical soirees: performers playing performers.  I have the sense that there is very little artifice in the cinematography.  That is, I feel that the filming techniques were not highly sophisticated.  But the eye, the light, the composition are almost perfect. I think that the other commenter (the only other one!) stated the themes quite well for me.  I would only one: the obsession and self-destructiveness that come with pride and jealousy of one's status.",5
Jalsaghar,"Good heavens! This is about as far from Bollywood movies (cheesy musicals) as one could get. Jalsaghar is a poignant rendering of social transition at the personal level -- the indigent aristocrat whose delusive and self-destructive obsession with bringing his music room back to life shields him from the reality of his family's economic and social collapse, and indeed hastens it; the showy nouveau-riche neighbor who embodies the rise of a new social order based on economic achievement rather than aristocratic roots and inherited wealth. There are parallels to Chekhov and Faulkner (Snopeses and Sartorises). The black and white images (the white horse!) are stunning. I saw this film in the 1980s, and remember it more clearly than the movie I saw last night. It is truly a classic.",0
Jalsaghar,"For me the most rewarding films (or any art for that matter) are those that are acutely mindful of life and death and themselves in the midst of it. In the words of Harold Bloom, ""We all fear loneliness, madness, dying. Shakespeare and Walt Whitman, Leopardi and Hart Crane will not cure those fears. And yet these poets bring us fire and light."" The same with all art, much of which this film epitomizes.""The Music Room"", as it is known in English, is as much about the power of cinema as it is about that of music. It is as much about life as it is about death, both elliptically consummate by reason of each other: art as a life of inspiration, inspiration as regained strength. Art as addiction, addiction as loneliness, loneliness as death.The ending is one of the most filmically mesmerizing moments I know of. Light and shadow, derangement and perspicuity, again life and death. And as for the Blu-ray (Region A) released by the Criterion Collection in 2011, it's phenomenal to the hilt, a cultural act in itself, in my books among their most enduring and best releases so far (perhaps only the complete Jean Vigo compares).",5
Jalsaghar,"When I first saw the Music Room in a big screen at the Ice-skating Ring Calcutta, I found it to be slow but intriguing. Since then whenever I watched this film, I felt I rediscovered it once again. When I found that the Criterion Collection has released the DVD version, I didn't think twice to buy it from Amazon though the price is more than sum total of all the Satyajit DVD/VCDs I have ever purchased. With a superb digital restoration, it is an audio-visual pleasure to watch the khayal recital in the backdrop of the looming disaster, the Kathak performance, tinkling sound of the chandelier, the night scene and so on. Analysis of the film by the French television channel and by Andrew Robinson is a delightful bonus. What a love and perfection that have gone in to restore this masterpiece from oblivion in this heritage apathetic country!",5
Jalsaghar,"Satyajit Ray made ""The Music Room"" in 1958, a few years after ""Pather Panchali"" and before completing the rest of the Apu Trilogy and like them, it too is a masterpiece. It's about the sin of pride and how it destroys the supercilious old landlord Biswambhar Roy, (a magnificent performance from Chhabi Biswas), whose idea of 'keeping up with the Jones'' is to squander all he has on musical evenings that will outdo those of his nearest neighbour. It's also about the transformative affect of music, of which there is much and all of it wonderful. Although you might say it destroys him Biswambhar is also redeemed by opening up his music room for one last great concert.This is also one of the cinema's greatest studies of obsession and of loneliness. If ""Pather Panchali"" were not enough this confirmed Ray's stature as one of world cinema's greatest directors and it is a film that remains as powerful today as it did when it first appeared. Treasure it.",5
Jalsaghar,"No review could ever do this incredible film full justice. This is not Satyajit Ray's most famous work but it's probably his most satisfying. The cinematography, shadow & light play alongside the film's music combine to perfectly highlight the moments of elation and ultimate downfall of its lead character. Chhabi Biswas is perfectly cast as the ageing zamindar oblivious to his world crumbling down around him. Reportedly panned by some critics on its release in India, the film went on to find success in Western Europe. Now after years of having to contend with grainy transfers on DVD, New York's Criterion Collection have released a pristine remastered edition that highlights every single beautifully shot frame. The cleaned up audio does wonders for the incredible music & classical dance scenes, which feature a guest appearance from Ustad Waheed Khan. If you have any interest in real cinema and even if you're not a Ray fan, this is one of the greatest examples of what a totally flawless film looks like.",5
Jalsaghar,"""The Newsweek"" magazine once asked Henri Cartier-Bresson , the great French photographer considered to be the father of modern photojournalism , during an interview to name his favorite film. Bresson replied -"" Satyajit's Ray's 'The Music Rom'. An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.""""The Music Room"" is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray's devotion to a single mood: elegiac. Ray isn't alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy, cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee's short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film, making music, rather being an interlude, an integral part of the screenplay. In ""Jalsaghar or The Music Room"", Ray examines the age-old conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree, between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated ""Apu Trilogy"",Ray explores how one man's need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It's a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth.Set in the 1930's with the emerging nouveau rich, Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs, stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert, a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone, as are other subjects (his dog, horse, elephant). The film begins with the elderly Zamindar (landlord) sitting alone, staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 15-20 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar, with his young son Khoka and wife Padma (the realist/pragmatist to Huzar's idealism) was the class of his region, hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar's centerpiece, his ivory tower and final refuge from the external reality/realism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar's pride, his heirloom, his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially, in concentric circles, from the outer oasis, to the backyard pool/yard, to the mansion, to the music room and further yet, the music room's stage. Likewise Mitra's camera often, and nearly always in relation to Roy, dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him, but counterpoints the film's maze-like construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra's cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere. "" Music Room"" is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots (the insect dying in the glass, the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river, the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room, the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur's states of mind , and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait) and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film's maze-like construction and Roy being trapped in his past. ""The Music Room"" remains as a majestic masterpiece of a man's monumental effort to cling to his illustrious legacy and hold his head high when his feet wither.",5
Jalsaghar,"Glorious filmmaking, a spellbinding morality tale of pride. Elegant cinematography, a perfect location and an elaborate set, and three amazing musical performances, each more electrifying than the last. I could watch that final dance over and over again. And of course, there's Chhabi Biswas dominating in the lead (although the other actors are excellent as well), portraying a man caught between his pride and the changing times, and suffering the consequences. The film isn't perfect -- for one thing, I'd like to see more time devoted to Khoka to help establish the emotional connection, not to mention Roy's wife -- but it is quite magnificent and captivating.",5
Jalsaghar,"In the fourth feature film directed by Satyajit Ray, Jalsaghar, we are treated to a magnificent spectacle of musical performances, Hindu dance, and a powerful film thrown some place in the mix. Jalsaghar tells the gloomy tale of a landlord living in Bengal whom has just lost his wife and beloved son in a horrid boating accident. The landlord, Roy (Chhabi Biswas), takes to a basic role of silence and mourning by spending his days sitting aside his hookah to pass the time. Biswas is exceptional in his performance of Roy by revealing a side to the character of near-perfect emptiness in a human being; he shows us what the empty body of a man can become.The film is a decorative wonder to watch and hear to any degree. A graceful and vivid use of cinematography brings out the rich and sweeping palace in which Roy spends his time. Various close-ups of chandeliers and jewelry create a montage of empty wealth. Later on in the film when we are introduced to the many performances which will be carried out in the landlord's music room, the film comes full circle as an audio delight as well. Beautiful Hindu compositions are performed in full length throughout sweeping-music video like coverage scanning the pitch-perfect vocalists on to the unique Indian instruments tooting away. As the music grows to inspire Roy to overcome his grief, we grow along with Roy and feel the inspiration of the songs as well.Despite its depressing subject matter, Jalsaghar is a great delight throughout its in entire runtime. Sympathizing with the victimized Roy as well as his loyal and motivational subjects, you will really overcome an exquisite experience as the characters try to pick Roy's spirits up through words, song, and dance. Overall this is a must-see film for anyone with a passion for film, music, or both although it is recommended you enter in good spirt.",5
Jalsaghar,"There is quite a bit that I admired about this Indian film, however there are also a number of aspects that, whether it be for objective or subjective reasons, I did not particularly about it. On the positive side, what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting, as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating, not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too, capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood, however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes, such as the fireworks, but the feel they generally provide is graininess, which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together, rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes, such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter, tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters, all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed, but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall, what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece, and maybe it is, but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge. I do however think that it is a good piece of cinema, and I agree that it is deserving of respect. Even if one may not enjoy it, there is enough to be appreciated here to make it a worthwhile watch.",0
Jalsaghar,"Besides of all of the well known, familiar, typical Bollywood type of movies, India was also capable of delivering some genuinely good, little movies.What makes this movie a good one is that it's being a rather simplistic and little drama, that actually works out more effective because of that. It focuses mainly one main character, that is slowly starting to realize he is loosing everything because of the changing times. It's a movie that works on a dramatic level with its main character and makes all of his emotions and feeling come across very realistic and almost sensible.Of course the movie is not as stylized and perfectly put together as a big Hollywood movie from around the same time period but nevertheless ""Jalsaghar"" still is one fine put together movie, by director Satyajit Ray. You can really tell he is a director that progressed over the years, as he gained more and more experience, recognition and money to work with.Really visually this movie is being great. I really liked the black & white cinematography by Subrata Mitra, who started out his movie career along with Satyajit Ray. It's a movie with an heavy Indian atmosphere over it, so the lovers of its culture will definitely be able to appreciate this movie, all the more.Simply one fine, effective little drama.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",4
Jalsaghar,"Tagore in one of his short stories had written (while describing a husband's desperate effort to hold on to his wife when there was no hope) that when one tries harder to grab on to a fistful of mercury it only flows out more through the gaps of the fingers.I think this same analogy describes this movie perfectly. The old Zamindar tries really really hard to hold on to the lost glory of his family through his music room (Jalsaghar) when there's no hope. He loses everything. He loses his mind. And finally in an act of madness loses his very life.I think, through this movie Ray has brought out something very essential to being a human being: Pride (mixed with false hope) and its power to drive a person insane.One of Ray's masterpieces: will definitely compel you to watch more of Ray's films.",5
Jalsaghar,"This was seen in the monthly Foreign Film Series in a society for retired university (KU) peeps. This 1958 story is remarkably subtle, about the advancing age and declining wealth of a higher caste Indian man, a Zamindar (landlord), whose income from his inherited lands is dropping from the previous levels of his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property and income. He's unable to adjust his manner of living to either that change or simultaneous changes in the Indian economy that lead to new economic benefits and social mobility for many in lower castes. He's especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes from money lending rather than through inherited property and wealth; he engages in expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford and these leave him even poorer. Through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married and had a son (16? 18?); both wife and son died together on a trip. So he's alone for many years. While Indian music is his primary comfort (played in ""the music room"" of his palatial home), he also begins to use it as his primary club against his ""upstart"" neighbor. As he ages we see his memory decline, e.g., asking one of his two remaining servants, ""What month is this?"" before he presents one last concert for invited guests (and to belittle his rival, his lower caste neighbor, an included guest) before he then embarks on an activity which leads to his death. Great examples of Indian music (but the closed captions on the DVD we saw had white type/lettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background). The movie also very subtly raises the question -- to what extent is this person (one's self or relative or friend) going through parallel sequences in the getting old process?",4
Jalsaghar,"Depicts the end days of a decadent zamindar (landlord) in Bengal, and his efforts to uphold his family prestige even when faced with economic adversity.After the box office failure of ""Aparajito"", Ray desperately needed a hit film and decided to make a film based on both a popular piece of literature and a film that would incorporate Indian music. It was the first film to extensively incorporate classical Indian music and dancing.For the life of me, I haven't found an Indian film -- classic or contemporary -- that I really liked. The ""Apu trilogy"" does nothing for me, and Bollywood is a disaster. But ""Music Room"" may be the first exception... and it is precisely because of the traditional music. The cinematography is really good, but that music!",4
Jalsaghar,"Music and passion without those to share it with is without value, dried leaves rustling along the ground and pettiness to win burns them...It's Indian, but I wouldn't call it Bollywood, it's more like Ingmar Bergman in its depth. The story is about a wealthy man whose life is music and putting on parties for friends, but he doesn't really enjoy the music he just does it to one up his neighbors who he feels in competition with... his wife and son go out in a storm and die not to return, and he becomes a recluse in his castle, and at the end of his life he puts on one more final concert. What I glean from it, is a cautionary tale about how we live our lives, to have passion, and to share it openly with our loved ones and not to neglect them for pettiness. The film is amazing as a cautionary tale, but I felt it could have shown some form of redemption in the end, rather than racing out to regain something, out of fear for his own mortality, more so a sense of humility and love for his family he lost, neglected all that time... I don't feel we see that in the film.",4
Jalsaghar,"The United States economy appears to be built on historical self-image, rather than on genuine products and services. Those we reward with the greatest remuneration either entertain us with sport circuses, or shift figures around to convince others that shifting jobs and facilities overseas is actually good for the nation. Sadly, the economy of the Bush years more resembles the tragic hero of Satyajit Ray's ""The Music Room,"" -- whose title and nobility make social requirements for him to provide entertainments, and whose patrimony make financial requirements, which he has no wherewithal to maintain: eventually he bankrupts himself to the very moneylenders he entertains at his home, to maintain an image only he felt obligated to maintain. Herbert (NYTimes, 11/10/2007) is certainly right to challenge the establishment view that the economy is fine, thank you.",5
Jalsaghar,"I saw this film in 1991, and I've been meaning to track down a copy ever since. I don't know, is it the self-indulgent protagonist I identify with? For me, I was touched by most of this film, because I feel that the power of music is both a symbol and a seducer; this is something I've 'known' in my own life. I'd really want to see this again because I can't remember if this is really what the film is as luscious and about what I think. It couldn't be further away from the type of music appreciation in Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" with its autistic obsession for compiling and list-making. Instead it is perhaps just as masturbatory in the sense that it can really only be enjoyed on your own.",5
Jalsaghar,"Some of the Bollywood movies are excellent, but others are of little interest to anyone but India natives or language speakers.This subtitled film (ESPECIALLY this one) is not one I would have wanted to see, and didn't deserve the 8.2 rating is had on May 12, 2007, but maybe it does to someone from India.The the film is grainy and the topic is ""corny"" to me (a 'murrican).I suggest that the ratings of Bollywood films be taken with a ""grain of salt"" until you have viewed several of them.I would like to see ratings marked ""subtitled version"" or ""original language version"".",3
Jalsaghar,"There are many places where this film could have ended, and it would have been a better film, such as (a) after the storm, (b) with the house in ruins, even (c) after the triumphant final performance. Instead, after a mostly serious film, an absurd ending is quickly tacked on, insulting the audience.Since so many people are promoting this film, I'm going to dwell on the negative, although keep in mind that I do think it's worth watching.Among the several weaknesses of the film are: (1) the man's relationship to his wife/courtesan is not made clear. She appears out of nowhere, has a few scenes, and disappears never to be seen again. but we're told she survived the trip. (2) the man's relationship to his son, whom he seems to genuinely miss when he's gone, although perhaps more out of a blood-line legacy thing than a personal relationship. (3) everyone's relationship to the nouveau-riche down the block is unclear -- why do they attack his car? Why doesn't he initially like the music? Is he just as lazy as the hero of our story? A particular annoyance is the filmmaker's determination to dwell on every last note of the very grating and entirely unnecessary music. It doesn't move the plot. It doesn't reveal character. It does set the scene, which is good. But in some cases, particularly during the dance, the singing and instruments are heard even though the singers and musicians are clearly not making noise. Anyway, the music is local flavour, and we get the point after a few minutes. We don't need to be drowned in it. I learned on IMDb that portions of the vocalizations were not words, and that's why they had no subtitles. As closed captions often do, the subtitling should have told us this, so we know that we aren't missing any meaning.I'm ambivalent about the storm. It's described as a cyclone (at least in the English subtitles) which it clearly is not. We have summer storms that look like that where I live on a regular basis, and they're nothing. Yet, I also applaud the use of what appears to be actual lightning in a film. That's pretty rare, and should be encouraged.Despite all that, it's still a good story of obsession, bigotry, and entitlement, living in a past that most could not afford.For what it's worth, and not to say these are reasonable comparisons, but the films that came to my mind watching this one were: any of the Grey Gardens films, and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).",4
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"At the time I post this, only 123 people have cast a vote of any kind for The Music Room.  What a shame.Satyajit Ray is one of the greatest directors of all-time and The Music Room is his masterpiece.  Correction: The Music Room is a masterpiece of world cinema.How to describe this movie?  In Hollywood lingo, you could call it Citizen Kane meets Black Narcissus with a big dose of King Lear.  Of course, if you called it that, they'd shelve the project and spend the money on the sequel to XXX.Pity poor Biswambhar Roy, a king in a lonely castle.  He's lost not only his family but his entire way of life.  He is a mistake.  A forgotten man waiting in his empty shell of a world.He spends the last remnants of his once vast fortune on a final, lavish musical performance in his crumbling home, a last-ditch attempt to connect to the pride and joy he once felt in his life.Not that he is innocent.  He is proud and oblivious, spoiled and selfish. But surely not a bad man.  Merely a displaced man.  So we can cheer as he is granted one last moment of happiness and weep for him as he meets his inevitable end.How is that Satyajit Ray remains unknown even to many die-hard cineastes in the States?  I hope one of the companies will come along soon and release some of his work on DVD.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"WARNING -- PLOT DISCUSSED -- The jalsaghar is a great music hall in the mansion of the main character, a scion of a great landowning family. It's almost all he has left of the Ray family's legacy. Over the years his land has been slowly eaten away by one of the great rivers of Bengal. But he still has the trappings of aristocracy -- his retainers address him as ""Hujur"" (""my lord""); even his wealthy neighbour, Ganguli, addresses him as ""Thakurda"" (""(paternal) grandfather""). He lives only for his jalsaghar, where he can recreate his family's past glory and where he can still win a game of one-upmanship against Ganguli. Meanwhile, Ganguli is up-and-coming. He's a businessman, the new aristocrat, land-poor but cash-rich. He gets electric lights for his house; he gets a motor car, the first in the region. Satyajit Ray, the legendary director, masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas, a legend of the Calcutta stage. (An interesting aside -- ""chhabi"" is Bengali for ""picture"" and ""biswas"" means ""belief."") He fit the mold of a classic actor -- temperamental, undependable, a raging alcoholic, a master. Almost every scene is wholly dependent on him, as he preens and boasts and rages and pines away for lost glory. When you read that Biswas was in real life completely tone-deaf, his creation of a music-lover is an astonishing accomplishment, both by him and by Satyajit Ray.",0
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"The Music Room is my favorite S. Ray film, and I came around to seeing it very late in the game. I do not hesitate when I say that it is perfect, and contains the single greatest musical number ever set to film. It amazes me when I pop in a picture made 50 years ago and learn so much from it, and am moved and shocked and carried by its honest emotions in a way that makes the Music Room feel so modern. It is now available in a tremendous Criterion version, so there should be no excuse on the part of cinephiles to miss this film. I introduce it to as many people as I can, and I consider it an act of kindness paid forward.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Just to appreciate Roshan Kumari's legendary performance -one of the most mesmerizing dancing sequences ever filmed, this masterpiece deserves a repeated viewing. There is something savage, auto-destructive but also the purest in form about the landlord's passion for music and childish vanity in front of his peers, which made me ponder over the place of music in our society long after the credits end. In the age of MTV and MP3, we are used to the idea of carrying routinely our favorite songs everywhere from streets to bathroom, and it's pity that we hardly experience anymore the authentic ambiance of intimate music gathering such as miraculously acted and filmed in Jalsaghar. Music in other era and other place must have been high point and extra-ordinary moment of community life, source of the spiritual inspiration for civil life as well as its destruction. The decor and lighting of the music room is sumptuous and otherworldly, in perfect contrast with the wearisome monotony of domestic scenes the declining aristocrat is forced to endure.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Jalsaghar (aka ""The Music Room"") is a 1958 drama film directed by master Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the pre-independence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindarsa dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur's glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray's fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijitothe finally film in Ray's much acclaimed ""The Apu Trilogy"". Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film, based on some popular work of literature, which would incorporate popular Indian music. But, what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an art-house work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian box-office. But, it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie's dark and gloomy tone. The movie's melancholic musical composition and sombre art directionthe sublime use of mirrors, chandeliers, etc.gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American Film-Noir films of the '40s and '50s.In Jalsaghar, Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that, having stood the test of time for over five decades, continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray's most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray's oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray's films, especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But, a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thought-provoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema. Jalsaghar.is an essential watch for all Satyajit Ray fans as well as those who understand and appreciate intelligent cinema. 10/10A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"The film is a masterpiece, a definite 10.  As with the Apu trilogy, I am mesmerized and absorbed by the pacing and drama of the film. Even though the film uses music, its appreciation, and its status as the vehicle for its themes, there is no (or very little?) background music for the spoken portions of the film.  This provides not only realism, but sets off the intense and magnificent performance of the protagonist.  There is also a great deal of entertainment in this film: the music performances are excellent.  I wonder if Ray found the best musicians of the region and gave them roles as performers in the musical soirees: performers playing performers.  I have the sense that there is very little artifice in the cinematography.  That is, I feel that the filming techniques were not highly sophisticated.  But the eye, the light, the composition are almost perfect. I think that the other commenter (the only other one!) stated the themes quite well for me.  I would only one: the obsession and self-destructiveness that come with pride and jealousy of one's status.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Good heavens! This is about as far from Bollywood movies (cheesy musicals) as one could get. Jalsaghar is a poignant rendering of social transition at the personal level -- the indigent aristocrat whose delusive and self-destructive obsession with bringing his music room back to life shields him from the reality of his family's economic and social collapse, and indeed hastens it; the showy nouveau-riche neighbor who embodies the rise of a new social order based on economic achievement rather than aristocratic roots and inherited wealth. There are parallels to Chekhov and Faulkner (Snopeses and Sartorises). The black and white images (the white horse!) are stunning. I saw this film in the 1980s, and remember it more clearly than the movie I saw last night. It is truly a classic.",0
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"For me the most rewarding films (or any art for that matter) are those that are acutely mindful of life and death and themselves in the midst of it. In the words of Harold Bloom, ""We all fear loneliness, madness, dying. Shakespeare and Walt Whitman, Leopardi and Hart Crane will not cure those fears. And yet these poets bring us fire and light."" The same with all art, much of which this film epitomizes.""The Music Room"", as it is known in English, is as much about the power of cinema as it is about that of music. It is as much about life as it is about death, both elliptically consummate by reason of each other: art as a life of inspiration, inspiration as regained strength. Art as addiction, addiction as loneliness, loneliness as death.The ending is one of the most filmically mesmerizing moments I know of. Light and shadow, derangement and perspicuity, again life and death. And as for the Blu-ray (Region A) released by the Criterion Collection in 2011, it's phenomenal to the hilt, a cultural act in itself, in my books among their most enduring and best releases so far (perhaps only the complete Jean Vigo compares).",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"When I first saw the Music Room in a big screen at the Ice-skating Ring Calcutta, I found it to be slow but intriguing. Since then whenever I watched this film, I felt I rediscovered it once again. When I found that the Criterion Collection has released the DVD version, I didn't think twice to buy it from Amazon though the price is more than sum total of all the Satyajit DVD/VCDs I have ever purchased. With a superb digital restoration, it is an audio-visual pleasure to watch the khayal recital in the backdrop of the looming disaster, the Kathak performance, tinkling sound of the chandelier, the night scene and so on. Analysis of the film by the French television channel and by Andrew Robinson is a delightful bonus. What a love and perfection that have gone in to restore this masterpiece from oblivion in this heritage apathetic country!",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Satyajit Ray made ""The Music Room"" in 1958, a few years after ""Pather Panchali"" and before completing the rest of the Apu Trilogy and like them, it too is a masterpiece. It's about the sin of pride and how it destroys the supercilious old landlord Biswambhar Roy, (a magnificent performance from Chhabi Biswas), whose idea of 'keeping up with the Jones'' is to squander all he has on musical evenings that will outdo those of his nearest neighbour. It's also about the transformative affect of music, of which there is much and all of it wonderful. Although you might say it destroys him Biswambhar is also redeemed by opening up his music room for one last great concert.This is also one of the cinema's greatest studies of obsession and of loneliness. If ""Pather Panchali"" were not enough this confirmed Ray's stature as one of world cinema's greatest directors and it is a film that remains as powerful today as it did when it first appeared. Treasure it.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"No review could ever do this incredible film full justice. This is not Satyajit Ray's most famous work but it's probably his most satisfying. The cinematography, shadow & light play alongside the film's music combine to perfectly highlight the moments of elation and ultimate downfall of its lead character. Chhabi Biswas is perfectly cast as the ageing zamindar oblivious to his world crumbling down around him. Reportedly panned by some critics on its release in India, the film went on to find success in Western Europe. Now after years of having to contend with grainy transfers on DVD, New York's Criterion Collection have released a pristine remastered edition that highlights every single beautifully shot frame. The cleaned up audio does wonders for the incredible music & classical dance scenes, which feature a guest appearance from Ustad Waheed Khan. If you have any interest in real cinema and even if you're not a Ray fan, this is one of the greatest examples of what a totally flawless film looks like.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"""The Newsweek"" magazine once asked Henri Cartier-Bresson , the great French photographer considered to be the father of modern photojournalism , during an interview to name his favorite film. Bresson replied -"" Satyajit's Ray's 'The Music Rom'. An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.""""The Music Room"" is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray's devotion to a single mood: elegiac. Ray isn't alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy, cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee's short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film, making music, rather being an interlude, an integral part of the screenplay. In ""Jalsaghar or The Music Room"", Ray examines the age-old conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree, between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated ""Apu Trilogy"",Ray explores how one man's need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It's a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth.Set in the 1930's with the emerging nouveau rich, Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs, stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert, a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone, as are other subjects (his dog, horse, elephant). The film begins with the elderly Zamindar (landlord) sitting alone, staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 15-20 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar, with his young son Khoka and wife Padma (the realist/pragmatist to Huzar's idealism) was the class of his region, hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar's centerpiece, his ivory tower and final refuge from the external reality/realism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar's pride, his heirloom, his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially, in concentric circles, from the outer oasis, to the backyard pool/yard, to the mansion, to the music room and further yet, the music room's stage. Likewise Mitra's camera often, and nearly always in relation to Roy, dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him, but counterpoints the film's maze-like construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra's cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere. "" Music Room"" is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots (the insect dying in the glass, the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river, the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room, the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur's states of mind , and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait) and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film's maze-like construction and Roy being trapped in his past. ""The Music Room"" remains as a majestic masterpiece of a man's monumental effort to cling to his illustrious legacy and hold his head high when his feet wither.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Glorious filmmaking, a spellbinding morality tale of pride. Elegant cinematography, a perfect location and an elaborate set, and three amazing musical performances, each more electrifying than the last. I could watch that final dance over and over again. And of course, there's Chhabi Biswas dominating in the lead (although the other actors are excellent as well), portraying a man caught between his pride and the changing times, and suffering the consequences. The film isn't perfect -- for one thing, I'd like to see more time devoted to Khoka to help establish the emotional connection, not to mention Roy's wife -- but it is quite magnificent and captivating.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"In the fourth feature film directed by Satyajit Ray, Jalsaghar, we are treated to a magnificent spectacle of musical performances, Hindu dance, and a powerful film thrown some place in the mix. Jalsaghar tells the gloomy tale of a landlord living in Bengal whom has just lost his wife and beloved son in a horrid boating accident. The landlord, Roy (Chhabi Biswas), takes to a basic role of silence and mourning by spending his days sitting aside his hookah to pass the time. Biswas is exceptional in his performance of Roy by revealing a side to the character of near-perfect emptiness in a human being; he shows us what the empty body of a man can become.The film is a decorative wonder to watch and hear to any degree. A graceful and vivid use of cinematography brings out the rich and sweeping palace in which Roy spends his time. Various close-ups of chandeliers and jewelry create a montage of empty wealth. Later on in the film when we are introduced to the many performances which will be carried out in the landlord's music room, the film comes full circle as an audio delight as well. Beautiful Hindu compositions are performed in full length throughout sweeping-music video like coverage scanning the pitch-perfect vocalists on to the unique Indian instruments tooting away. As the music grows to inspire Roy to overcome his grief, we grow along with Roy and feel the inspiration of the songs as well.Despite its depressing subject matter, Jalsaghar is a great delight throughout its in entire runtime. Sympathizing with the victimized Roy as well as his loyal and motivational subjects, you will really overcome an exquisite experience as the characters try to pick Roy's spirits up through words, song, and dance. Overall this is a must-see film for anyone with a passion for film, music, or both although it is recommended you enter in good spirt.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"There is quite a bit that I admired about this Indian film, however there are also a number of aspects that, whether it be for objective or subjective reasons, I did not particularly about it. On the positive side, what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting, as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating, not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too, capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood, however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes, such as the fireworks, but the feel they generally provide is graininess, which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together, rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes, such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter, tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters, all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed, but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall, what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece, and maybe it is, but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge. I do however think that it is a good piece of cinema, and I agree that it is deserving of respect. Even if one may not enjoy it, there is enough to be appreciated here to make it a worthwhile watch.",0
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Besides of all of the well known, familiar, typical Bollywood type of movies, India was also capable of delivering some genuinely good, little movies.What makes this movie a good one is that it's being a rather simplistic and little drama, that actually works out more effective because of that. It focuses mainly one main character, that is slowly starting to realize he is loosing everything because of the changing times. It's a movie that works on a dramatic level with its main character and makes all of his emotions and feeling come across very realistic and almost sensible.Of course the movie is not as stylized and perfectly put together as a big Hollywood movie from around the same time period but nevertheless ""Jalsaghar"" still is one fine put together movie, by director Satyajit Ray. You can really tell he is a director that progressed over the years, as he gained more and more experience, recognition and money to work with.Really visually this movie is being great. I really liked the black & white cinematography by Subrata Mitra, who started out his movie career along with Satyajit Ray. It's a movie with an heavy Indian atmosphere over it, so the lovers of its culture will definitely be able to appreciate this movie, all the more.Simply one fine, effective little drama.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",4
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Tagore in one of his short stories had written (while describing a husband's desperate effort to hold on to his wife when there was no hope) that when one tries harder to grab on to a fistful of mercury it only flows out more through the gaps of the fingers.I think this same analogy describes this movie perfectly. The old Zamindar tries really really hard to hold on to the lost glory of his family through his music room (Jalsaghar) when there's no hope. He loses everything. He loses his mind. And finally in an act of madness loses his very life.I think, through this movie Ray has brought out something very essential to being a human being: Pride (mixed with false hope) and its power to drive a person insane.One of Ray's masterpieces: will definitely compel you to watch more of Ray's films.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"This was seen in the monthly Foreign Film Series in a society for retired university (KU) peeps. This 1958 story is remarkably subtle, about the advancing age and declining wealth of a higher caste Indian man, a Zamindar (landlord), whose income from his inherited lands is dropping from the previous levels of his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property and income. He's unable to adjust his manner of living to either that change or simultaneous changes in the Indian economy that lead to new economic benefits and social mobility for many in lower castes. He's especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes from money lending rather than through inherited property and wealth; he engages in expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford and these leave him even poorer. Through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married and had a son (16? 18?); both wife and son died together on a trip. So he's alone for many years. While Indian music is his primary comfort (played in ""the music room"" of his palatial home), he also begins to use it as his primary club against his ""upstart"" neighbor. As he ages we see his memory decline, e.g., asking one of his two remaining servants, ""What month is this?"" before he presents one last concert for invited guests (and to belittle his rival, his lower caste neighbor, an included guest) before he then embarks on an activity which leads to his death. Great examples of Indian music (but the closed captions on the DVD we saw had white type/lettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background). The movie also very subtly raises the question -- to what extent is this person (one's self or relative or friend) going through parallel sequences in the getting old process?",4
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Depicts the end days of a decadent zamindar (landlord) in Bengal, and his efforts to uphold his family prestige even when faced with economic adversity.After the box office failure of ""Aparajito"", Ray desperately needed a hit film and decided to make a film based on both a popular piece of literature and a film that would incorporate Indian music. It was the first film to extensively incorporate classical Indian music and dancing.For the life of me, I haven't found an Indian film -- classic or contemporary -- that I really liked. The ""Apu trilogy"" does nothing for me, and Bollywood is a disaster. But ""Music Room"" may be the first exception... and it is precisely because of the traditional music. The cinematography is really good, but that music!",4
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Music and passion without those to share it with is without value, dried leaves rustling along the ground and pettiness to win burns them...It's Indian, but I wouldn't call it Bollywood, it's more like Ingmar Bergman in its depth. The story is about a wealthy man whose life is music and putting on parties for friends, but he doesn't really enjoy the music he just does it to one up his neighbors who he feels in competition with... his wife and son go out in a storm and die not to return, and he becomes a recluse in his castle, and at the end of his life he puts on one more final concert. What I glean from it, is a cautionary tale about how we live our lives, to have passion, and to share it openly with our loved ones and not to neglect them for pettiness. The film is amazing as a cautionary tale, but I felt it could have shown some form of redemption in the end, rather than racing out to regain something, out of fear for his own mortality, more so a sense of humility and love for his family he lost, neglected all that time... I don't feel we see that in the film.",4
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"The United States economy appears to be built on historical self-image, rather than on genuine products and services. Those we reward with the greatest remuneration either entertain us with sport circuses, or shift figures around to convince others that shifting jobs and facilities overseas is actually good for the nation. Sadly, the economy of the Bush years more resembles the tragic hero of Satyajit Ray's ""The Music Room,"" -- whose title and nobility make social requirements for him to provide entertainments, and whose patrimony make financial requirements, which he has no wherewithal to maintain: eventually he bankrupts himself to the very moneylenders he entertains at his home, to maintain an image only he felt obligated to maintain. Herbert (NYTimes, 11/10/2007) is certainly right to challenge the establishment view that the economy is fine, thank you.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"I saw this film in 1991, and I've been meaning to track down a copy ever since. I don't know, is it the self-indulgent protagonist I identify with? For me, I was touched by most of this film, because I feel that the power of music is both a symbol and a seducer; this is something I've 'known' in my own life. I'd really want to see this again because I can't remember if this is really what the film is as luscious and about what I think. It couldn't be further away from the type of music appreciation in Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" with its autistic obsession for compiling and list-making. Instead it is perhaps just as masturbatory in the sense that it can really only be enjoyed on your own.",5
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"Some of the Bollywood movies are excellent, but others are of little interest to anyone but India natives or language speakers.This subtitled film (ESPECIALLY this one) is not one I would have wanted to see, and didn't deserve the 8.2 rating is had on May 12, 2007, but maybe it does to someone from India.The the film is grainy and the topic is ""corny"" to me (a 'murrican).I suggest that the ratings of Bollywood films be taken with a ""grain of salt"" until you have viewed several of them.I would like to see ratings marked ""subtitled version"" or ""original language version"".",3
Evadu Thakkuva Kadu,"There are many places where this film could have ended, and it would have been a better film, such as (a) after the storm, (b) with the house in ruins, even (c) after the triumphant final performance. Instead, after a mostly serious film, an absurd ending is quickly tacked on, insulting the audience.Since so many people are promoting this film, I'm going to dwell on the negative, although keep in mind that I do think it's worth watching.Among the several weaknesses of the film are: (1) the man's relationship to his wife/courtesan is not made clear. She appears out of nowhere, has a few scenes, and disappears never to be seen again. but we're told she survived the trip. (2) the man's relationship to his son, whom he seems to genuinely miss when he's gone, although perhaps more out of a blood-line legacy thing than a personal relationship. (3) everyone's relationship to the nouveau-riche down the block is unclear -- why do they attack his car? Why doesn't he initially like the music? Is he just as lazy as the hero of our story? A particular annoyance is the filmmaker's determination to dwell on every last note of the very grating and entirely unnecessary music. It doesn't move the plot. It doesn't reveal character. It does set the scene, which is good. But in some cases, particularly during the dance, the singing and instruments are heard even though the singers and musicians are clearly not making noise. Anyway, the music is local flavour, and we get the point after a few minutes. We don't need to be drowned in it. I learned on IMDb that portions of the vocalizations were not words, and that's why they had no subtitles. As closed captions often do, the subtitling should have told us this, so we know that we aren't missing any meaning.I'm ambivalent about the storm. It's described as a cyclone (at least in the English subtitles) which it clearly is not. We have summer storms that look like that where I live on a regular basis, and they're nothing. Yet, I also applaud the use of what appears to be actual lightning in a film. That's pretty rare, and should be encouraged.Despite all that, it's still a good story of obsession, bigotry, and entitlement, living in a past that most could not afford.For what it's worth, and not to say these are reasonable comparisons, but the films that came to my mind watching this one were: any of the Grey Gardens films, and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).",4
Chase,"I really enjoy this show, I don't care what the other reviews say! It's enjoyable, sure it's not anything life changing but it's fun enough, and keeps you guessing. The main characters are likable and you're always rooting for them. Sure there are some other cop shows out there like this, but give this one a shot! Kelli Giddish is great as Annie Frost, I like that this show has a very strong female lead! Cole Hauser is also good! and Jesse Metcalfe does well, I like seeing him in something that isn't like Desperate Housewives or John Tucker Must Die. Amaury Nolasco, and Rose Rollins really round out the team well.I really hope it doesn't get cancelled!!",5
Chase,"I disagree with all of the other reviews. Most people these days are just down right picky when it comes to their shows. This show is fun to watch. If you honestly enjoy having to watch shows like CSI where they have 10 different show pertaining to every city in the country and solving the same crimes, then by all means watch those shows.This show is very entertaining and moves at a quick pace.Most other cop shows on TV are very slow and the investigation portions tend to drag on.I think Chase is a very exciting show and I look forward to watching it every week.I hope that this show continues to make it beyond one season Hopefully this season continues to get better and starts to change peoples view of its quality.",5
Chase,"I love this actress! Annie Frost is not your run of the mill US Marshall diva who needs her makeup and hair done to a tee in every scene. Thank goodness Jerry Bruckheimer still casts women who have surprises under their sleeves. The writers are doing a fantastic job by keeping the story moving at a break neck speed and still add compassion in the b lines. I'm looking forward to watching this show every week. And with Cole Hauser, Jessie Metcalfe, Rose Rollins, and Amaury Nolasco, and not to mention Kelli Giddish, I can't lose. I love the guest stars who really love to be bad and Chase has those guys. if I were an actor, and cast on this show I would want to be the bad guy,because Kelli Giddish would take me down. please give this show a chance to show it's true colors by exposing the soft side, and the dysfunctional side of the cast. I'm a true fan.",4
Chase,"I have to admit the show started a little slow. Now, my family is fully engaged. Great cast and good writing has been the key. I like the way the characters are now be coming more complex. Anne Frost is really becoming a charter with passion and heart. I am looking forward to the growth of this cast. Bottem line, the show is just fun to watch! With all the copy cat CSI 1,2,3, NCIS, NCIS LA, Etc, it is nice to add a little Texas twist. I also think it is nice to have a strong leading lady. One the comes across very down to earth without to much ego. My 11 year old likes this show as well and it is one the whole family can really get into.",5
Chase,My fifteen year old granddaughter came to live with me in New Hampshire last April. She moved here to New Hampshire from the Houston area so when we saw this series starting we set it up to record. And we were so glad we did as we loved this show. There are so many violent sexual shows on television these days that to find a good easy to watch and understand show was a breath of fresh air. We were very disappointed when we kept looking for it to return. It was a good family show that I could feel comfortable watching with my granddaughter and her cousins when they visit. We would love to have the network bring this show back. We miss Annie Frost!,5
Chase,"Really loving this show a lot!It's fast-paced and action-packed. The interactions within the team are also very interesting to watch.Personally I love the main character of Annie Frost. 6 episodes into the first season I can't wait to see the development of these elements :Annie and Jimmy's history; cause you can just tell they've known each other for a long time and there's something brooding. Is Annie going to hunt down her own ' fugitive' father? Luke and Daisy , how are they going to react after their one night together? What's Marco's story? Are we going to see more of Ben the Bountyhunter?Until now I've found every villain fascinating and the chase thrilling. They have had some of the best guest actors playing the villains. I hope this show is going to have a 'long' life on NBC (kinda worried about the low ratings but *fingers crossed*",5
Chase,"I must admit, the only reason I even noticed this show was Cole Hauser. Seeing his face flash across the screen caught my attention, and even then only for a moment. But when I noticed that the show was coming up after The Event, I opted to stick on for a while. The first episode was slow with little depth to the characters. I had a hard time learning the names, only remembering Annie and Jimmy. There was potential for humor, but the writers quickly dropped it and moved on. The bad guy was admittedly an interesting person. I do like how the show creates sympathy for the criminals as well as the victims. And the show did have a lot of action, which kept me awake enough to finish it. It also was enough to get me to turn it on again for the second episode.I'm glad I gave it a second chance. While there was still not a whole lot of character development, we did learn a little about our heroes. I'm still not sure on some of the names, but I did see the supporting characters more in this episode. There was more humor, though somewhat dry. And once again, the bad guy was the best and most developed character in the whole plot.You almost wanted to sympathize with him more than the good guys and the victims. The episode ended nicely, if somewhat predictable. The 2nd episode was decidedly better than the first. Hopefully, it will continue to improve.",5
Chase,"Before seeing this new show I read the reviews that weren't enthusiastic. I saw the cast list and, really, I didn't see anything that I could love at first sight. I'm also confident that not necessarily a great cast will make a show more enjoyable than any other but it helps. It helps a lot. For example if you watched The Forgotten (by CSI producer Jerry Bruckheimer and also producer of this show), maybe you could find Christian Slater as a reference but not much more than that, and it was a very good show. Or The Beast, with Patrick Swayze, and you could find another good surprise there. Good shows with many people not so famous, not so charismatic. And I think that in Chase you have some chance of finding some good moments. Maybe if the show goes well you can connect with the cast. That option lays on good stories for the future. The first one wasn't disappointing. Maybe not great as anybody of us would want to watch, but not disappointing. It's just standard and that's pretty OK. Let's see what happens next.",4
Chase,"My husband and I watched Chase every week; we looked forward to watching it! The show was exciting; it was a family show... no sex or graphic episodes. There is so much junk on TV and so many shows are full of sex. Many times the sex scenes add little to nothing to the story line. The story lines on Chase were easy to follow; the plot moved quickly; there were no dead spots in the show at all, and the characters were realistic. We also enjoyed the fact that Chase was set in Ft. Worth, Texas. Go Texas!!!!!When I could not find Chase on the TV schedule, I became upset; I have been looking for weeks for a way to let the makers of Chase know that we miss the show and want it to return. PLEASE end the hiatus and return Chase to TV.",5
Chase,"I getting so sick of the implausibility of a super female cop who can kick every monstrous evil psycho she runs across when in reality a person like that just doesn't exist and never will........that is probably why, although it is not my cup of tea, the closer is a much more realistic and far and away better show.........brains instead of brawn and if she needs brawn, they follow her around like a well oiled machine...........this show is, on the other hand, summed up in the title of my review...........i'm not even going to waste a lot more words describing how boring and formulaic this show is..........i'm sure it will not last very long anyway..........too bad they wasted their money on so many episodes.......they should have waited to see how it would go.",1
Chase,"Big waste of time. No heart, soul, or any entertainment value I could find. Kelli Giddish was so plastic they should replace her with a Barbie Doll. With a new leading lady it might have a shot but I deleted it from my TIVO during the first commercial. I suppose my biggest disappointment was I found the criminal making his guest appearance the most interesting character. I could not have cared less about the rest of the cast. The lead character Annie Frost left me cold. She runs, she jumps, she stares, but when she's called upon to speak it made me cringe. Her interaction with children was just painful to watch. I would expect this in a B or C rated movie but there are so many great characters on TV these days that I love or love to hate or at least like that I'm surprised they gave her the lead to a show that seemed to have some potential. Ms. Giddish might be fine in another format, maybe a Doctor that has few lines but I felt she brought this one to a stop on a dime halt.",1
Chase,"I'm a sucker for cop shows so its no surprise this showed up on my radar for the new season. Unfortunately, i am a little disappointed.The show itself is a little too formulaic; the badass female cop with a ~*super secret dark past*~ and Daddy issues, the new kid who's more square than Spongebob, etc., but it is only the first episode. Hopefully it will pick up over the season and it won't just end up being ""another boring cop show"".The lead female scowls a little too much for my liking, but i'm glad to see Amaury Nolasco every week :D I'll definitely watch the next few episodes, but i won't be devastated if i happen to miss it one week.",3
Chase,"I often am surprised when certain shows garner low votes on IMDb, as I definitely feel there are worse than Chase on television.One commentator added that she felt uncomfortable with many shows on TV due to the level of their sexual content. Sweet lord Americans, is this all you're worried about? After all, Marshall Annie Frost goes through Chase following the crimes of heinous individuals who sometimes shoot entire families (this is not necessarily shown, but is implied in cutaways). Meanwhile Annie tracks down the bad guys, and often, when possible... shoots them dead. So let us sum of the moral compass of this ""family show"" as another reviewer termed it. Bad guys sometimes do really bad things, so it's a good thing when they die, and even better if you can shoot them.I do feel the aims and intentionality of the show's protagonists are just, but to worry over the sexual content? Really? By the way, two members of the team are sleeping with each other, and the two main leads, Annie and Jimmy, are growing ever-closer to the detriment of Jimmy's already-strained marriage. So- yeah, no sex, just home-wreckers and morning-after scenes with fornicators. Point being, these are not detractors, per se, but they neither elevate, nor sink the real content; violence should be the truer issue of concern to persons with concern for moral issues. Troglodytes.",4
Chase,I really enjoyed this show. I Needed something to watch after I finished Justified and Longmire. This fit in nicely.,5
Chase,"I only want to see an buy the one episodes that Travis Fimmel is in,,",5
Chase,"I watched this because I had seen ""Blue Bloods"" the night before and this was the only choice that looked interesting. Big mistake. It was not interesting. The acting was wooden and the characters unbelievable. There did not even seem to be the expected amount of real police ""work"" going on. They just ran and drove and flew all over chasing the guy. Guess this is why it is called Chase.It only took a very few minutes to want to turn this off. Good thing I had laundry to do instead.The villain was the only really compelling character. The actress playing his daughter, Sissy, was also quite good.My recommendation - give this one a pass. Don't waste the space on your TIVO or PVR",2
Chase,"what a terrible show, lacking content, acting and smoothness. The show would rank amongst amateur or student film productions (actually, some students films are better). They obviously did not take the time or effort and seems likeed they rushed the screenplay to make a quick buck or two.This show is evidence that producers are lacking the creativity that the industry used to have, and now they have to ""borrow"" previous ideas (""ie. the fugitive). Granted some remakes or ""borrowed"" films/shows are far superior to their predecessor, but this is not the case here.Terrible, waste of time and I suggest you flip the channel.I give it a 1/10 rating and that is very generous.",1
Chase,"I try to watch this show to see locations I recognize, but it gets harder every week because there are so few actual ""good guys."" The criminals are scummy and violent, but the US Marshalls aren't much better. They're human enough with each other, but with everyone else, they come across as macho, arrogant, and too quick to use violence of their own. Annie Frost sometimes shows her human side with frightened witnesses or victims, but usually only after she's yelled unnecessarily and shoved her badge down too many throats. In Part 2 of ""Narco,"" Jimmy Godfrey and most of his team were too ready to ignore procedure and break laws to get what they want. And it was ironic to hear Marco Martinez use torture as an example of what made a particular drug lord evil when he was talking to a partner who'd just come from torturing that same drug lord to get information.Maybe this show appeals to the primitive people who endorse torture as a legitimate tool and who believe in the ""whatever it takes to get the job done"" approach to law enforcement, but those people should not be encouraged. A cop show doesn't work if the cops are just as corrupt as the people they're chasing.",2
Chase,"But only without the Annie Frost character. We quit watching because we simply could not stand her. The character acted like she was a one woman show and completely ignored her team's safety. She was constantly putting herself and her team in danger and acted like she knew it all, usually with results that could have resulted in someone being seriously injured. Not that it would have mattered if it had been her. If you watch a show, you want it to be realistic and her grandstanding was horrible. Also, that accent was so horrible and when she would look at a victim's relative and say ""I'll get the them"", we would laugh out loud. Never the team would find the perpetrator but always ""her"". What a joke. It just got to the point where we quit watching the show. The rest of the cast was superb and I think they should bring the show back without her and it would work. Make Jimmy the team leader and make the team work together like they do in other Jerry Bruckheimer shows.",0
Chase,"A few months ago, I decided to give this show a chance. I lost interest almost immediately and actually stopped watching after only five episodes, so my response may not be the most accurate description, for all I know, the show kicked up after those five episodes, but for me, it already was doomed to fail, and I was not in the least bit surprised when it was canceled. Now, I like procedurals, so my opinion isn't based on the idea that it should have been a more serialized drama. However, there are ways that procedurals can be good, but Chase had too many flaws for that to ever happen.Flaw #1: The plot structureThe structure itself was nice in that the show wasn't a 'whodunit' kind of show, rather it let you know exactly who was being hunted and even showed scenes with the villain throughout the entire show, which, I'll admit is a nice change from the norm. However, where this failed was the way the supposed villains were written. With the exception of two episodes, the villains were actually written in a good light. They were three dimensional characters thatwhile they did horrible thingsthey had a good heart in different ways. The episode that really brought this to light was the fifth episode, ""Above the Law."" By the end of the episode, I was actually annoyed with the Marshalls for arresting the bad guy. Actually, on more than one occasion, I felt like I was rooting for the bad guy to win, which is not really a tactic a crime procedural should take. Unless, of course the point of the show was to make the bad guys the real heroes of the show, in which case it did a pretty decent job at that.Flaw #2: Annie FrostAnnie was probably the least likable character on the show, and given the fact that she was actually the main character, that's not a good thing. But probably the biggest problems with Annie was that A.) she was unrealistically good and always seemed to manage to take down the bad guy single-handedly, but B.) She was too reckless. In one episode, for example, her team is in the middle of a shootout with an incredibly dangerous killer. She sees him stop to reload his weapon. Common sense tells me that what she should have done was tell her team to move in, guns drawn and ready to shoot, before he has the chance to finish. If he doesn't, shoot him. Nobody would miss him. But instead, she puts her gun away and charges him to duke it out. It was incredibly reckless and could have gotten herself killed, and in the long run, could very well get her team killed. That is not a character trait you want your lead character to have. And what makes the whole situation is that her partner calls her out on it. But instead of actually listening to him, she accuses him of planning to tell the team about her father, or some other bull crap, I honestly lost interest in that storyline relatively quickly (which is actually the third flaw). Despite the fact that he told her on numerous occasions that his problems weren't about her father and, in fact, about her death wish, she kept going back to her same argument, which just makes her even more unlikeable. It also brings us to;Flaw #3: Annie's father storylineThe difference between proceduralsand even character driven proceduralsand character dramas is that the fundamental plot of the procedural is to solve the case, whether it be finding a murderer or finding out what's wrong with a medical patient, while a character drama pretty much tells the story of the characters. As such, the dramas can shove a lot of back-story into the characters from the get go and get away with it, they are, after all, the main purpose to the story. With a crime procedural, the audience doesn't have to know everything about the character from the start, but it can be gradually included over time. We know who the characters are, what they do and how they act and as the story goes on, we get better acquainted with the whys: Why they do what they do and why they act the way they act, etc. But with Chase, Annie's back-story with her father is used as a subplot throughout just about every episode (at least the ones I saw) to the point that I didn't care anymore. I didn't know the character enough to be that invested in her back-story, and I didn't even like her enough to care about how bad it was. Quite honestly, the fact that the argument with her partner, Jimmy (played by Cole Hauser who was actually pretty likable in this show), somehow managed to revolve around her father just enforced my problems. It was like the show-runners wanted people to be aware of Annie's daddy issues and wanted us to sympathize with her, but in reality, it just made her look dumb. The whole plot line was so contrived and forced upon us. I actually tried to watch the sixth episode and ended up turning it off after five minutes and never turned it back on, strictly because of this plot point. Chase, I imagine could have worked, but these major flaws pretty much guaranteed that it wouldn't last.",1
Chase,"This woman don't know how to act, she must be used as a stunt. The male talking style is really boring. The whole concept of this series is stupid.I have seen better series being canceled, and the current TV is full of policial series Chase's concept must be reviewed by TV producers, its boring and there is no innovation at all. I mean how many police series are in the air lately? After CSI there are no good policial series in the air.Kelli Giddish character has no credibility, her ""badass"" attitude is to false.",1
Chase,"Annie Frost is an amazing cop. The things she does are amazing stunts. I can't imagine a single genuine cop doing any of the stunts she pulls. Giving orders to staff to jump and expecting them to leap at the snap of her command, like it would really happen. Talking about cases in public, waving guns around and more. She certainly is hot (maybe a bit scrawny) and can wear boots well, but come on, she ain't no Chuck Norris. The plot lines are totally predictable and rehashed from other shows. The technological feats are totally improbable. A US Marshall running around in a personal car that's a Cadillac? There are just too many stretches from reality.",2
Chase,"It has been 7 years and hundreds cop shows, and somehow I still remember this show.
The best part of this marshal show is the prey; I still remember most of fugitives, every villain in the show has unique story, and the show always add one scene to reveal there was some humanity left in the monster: The wanna-be-marshal caught two real criminals; the robber/killer let his daughter go; even the serial killer who pretended to be paralyzed showed mercy to the family he met in the woods...
I guess the lesson here is that it's impossible to create 20 different colorful villains per year, the show seemed run out of gas after 10 episodes, the villains became less interesting and the show got cancelled.",3
Chase,"US Marshalls track down fugitives. This is traditional police procedural. Good or bad... this is Kelli Giddish's show. She's driving this show. The most notable thing about her is her smaller stature. She doesn't look like somebody who can take down muscle bound criminals. Early on, she has a big fight with a fugitive. Parts of it just look staged. Luckily she has the cop mannerism down. Maybe that's why she'd get Law & Order: SVU later on. This also stars Cole Hauser and Jesse Metcalfe.The main problem was it never nailed down what the show should look like. It has Kelli Giddish as a tough cop lead and pretty face Jesse Metcalfe. It seems to suggest a light weight cop show, but then they put in all kinds of action. It's certainly not gritty enough to be serious. It needs to be better.",3
ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"ABCD gives out a bad impression from its posters and trailer. But, it has more than meets the eye and I am transfixed with the base, the story and the plot.Starting with the two lead brats, it goes on to tell you the tale of how they manage their lives in Kerala, India after being born and brought up in New York. What is surprising is that every thing they do is unpredictable. The viewers will predict something else and the next sequence will totally be different. That is the charm of ABCD in the first half. Second half takes a narrow political turn, but is funnier as well. Both halves wonderfully frame the current affairs in Kerala and how the people there need only an inkling to create brouhaha.Performances are great. Jacob Gregory pulls it off very well and he is the funnier guy. Dulquer Salman acts over-cool, but he's okay. Lalu Alex is very sharp while the lead actress has equivocal stances. Music is catchy & apt but I have heard many of the tunes before. Score is inventive. Editing is fine, so is the direction.The running time of 170 minutes makes us question the intentions of the makers, and with the climax so cold, it felt like it ended abruptly. I had expected a more unconventional turn of twists. But, overall, ABCD scores!BOTTOM LINE: Fresh writing delivers chewable entertainment stuff.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Strong | Nudity/Sex: No | Vulgarity: Mild | Violence: Strong | Gore: No | Smoking: Mild | Alcohol: Strong | Drugs: No",4
ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"I had started this movie almost with no expectations since I had seen many political scenes involved in preview. Then the BGM fixed me to the seat. The story was fresh and made us wonder how better can it get,I was not a DQ fan, but this made me a die- hard one. About the acting DQ had done a very role of a playboy-Brat- type and Aparna as a matured-responsible- one. The script is brilliant . This movie showed a satirical part of politics in Kerala. Honestly speaking I had watched around 80 times and still didn't get bored . I'm sure everyone will just love this movie full of life and Zest . They should take more movies like this.",5
ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"This film appears on TV all the time. It is apparently very popular among Kerala's youth. I found it to be a mostly loud but also amusing and watchable.Two spoilt yuppie NRI's arrive in Kerala and are put to a test by their rich father to see whether they can survive like poor Malayalis do. His intention is to teach them the value of money and hard work. They bumble along and some of their antics were quite funny.Dulqer is not much of a comedian but then these are still early days in his budding career. Jacob Gregory's performance must have been made in the editing room. Aparna Gopinath with her pseudo intellectual look was annoying as always.The plot reminded me of some of the 90's films starring Jayram like Witness, Nagarangalil Chennu Raaparkaam and Varnam. All of these films involve two unemployed youths trying hard to get by.Martin Parakkat the director later went on to make the insufferable Charlie.",2
ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"I thought it would be a good movie but it didn't appeal. Two rich spoilt brat are sent to Kerala to stay with minimum money by which they can sustain and learn something useful. But at the end it didn't make much of a difference and some things were unreal so didn't stand out. Lalu Alex is a legend actor and his performance is always great. Korah was funny.
Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",3
ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"ABCD is a movie set in a new premise and narrates a fresh story. It starts off well but loses its focus n clarity post the 1st half. ABCD is the story of a a young man Johns living his luxurious youth life in New York. Certain situations in his and his buddy Korah's life lands them up in India and they are forced not to go back. Why and what they do next is the movie..ABCD becomes less engaging and slow post interval. Though the climax comes as a relief for the audience, by then we would have already been wondering why this isn't over yet.ABCD has very few scenes that makes us laugh. But they seem isolated and artificial in the narrative. Johns and Korah's situation in Kerala was not well exploited in the script and that results in the dullness of the movie. The script, the characters should have been much more smarter, crisp and engaging. Then this would have been too good. ABCD falls short of what it could have been.Performance wise Dulquer needs some polishing in the acting department. Jacob Gregory manages off well. Tovino's debut is not bad. Aparna Nair did her part smooth and nice. But apart from all these,, the show stealer was Gopi sunder with the Background Score. Loved the way he used the windows and apple tunes in a fun scene. Though there are certain scenes without any dialogues BG score makes us laugh giving the scenes a comedy touch. Thumbs up for him (y) Go in without any expectations for ABCD. If you are a dulquer fan, may be you will like this.",3
Wrong Number,"Just when I think Pakistani movies are heading in the right direction they come up with stuff like this.""If you can't beat them, join them"", this was what Mr and Mrs Nawaz thought after watching a modern Bollywood comedy and they probably said to their selves, ""why can't we get away with this, Sajid Khan did, and it's not like the people in Pakistan have any more sense then those in India. Why go through the effort of building an entire film when you can just get a cheap script, fill it with dirty humor and two item songs and we have ourselves 130 minutes of utter nonsense"" and that's when they decided to make this piece of crap they so proudly call a movie.This movie has nothing going for it, the plot, the acting, the screenplay, the direction, nothing is worth mentioning and there was absolutely no character development or chemistry whatsoever in fact I've seen cave paintings with better stories than this movie.Coming back to the inappropriate jokes/scenes, two families with little kids walked out of the theater halfway through the movie. If this is Nida Yasir's idea of a family film after years of doing a morning show then God help us.Last year it was Na Maloom Afraad and now this, these ""commercial movies"" aren't really aiding the resurrection of Lollywood, they're just stabbing it in the face with a blunt knife.",1
Wrong Number,"(Spoilers Ahead) What's the sure-shot way to launch a blockbuster at the box office, when there's an intersection of a festival and long weekend? Create a masala entertainer, market it on (literally) every platform and get loads and loads of business. Well, that's exactly what YNH (Yasir Nawaz, Nida Yasir and Hassan Zia) Films did. Wrong No. is one of the most hyped movies of this year, produced in Pakistan. Yasir and Nida have produced Nadaaniaan (a TV Sitcom) that gained massive popularity. One can only expect mega dose of laughter and entertainment from their first movie. Danish Taimoor, after Jalaibee needed a performance to save his career in the Pakistani movie industry. Javed Sheikh is has proved yet again that his comic timing is among the finest ones in the industry after Na Maloom Afraad's huge success. Would Wrong No. be able to do great business at the box office? Will it be a turning point for the main leads? Let's explore! Wrong No. starts with Sallu (Danish) running away from his home because his father Haji Abba (a butcher by profession) wants him to get married with Laila (Sohai Ali Abro) and join him in his business either of which Sallu doesn't want. Sallu plans to sneak in the empire of Sheharyar (Sallu's look alike). Shehryar visits Pakistan for the first time and his subordinate Haya (Janita Asma) visits Karachi from Lahore to take him to Lahore. On the contrary, Shera (Shafqat Cheema) and Danish Nawaz both want to abduct Sheharyar to get ransom from his grandfather who is a Nawab (Qavi Khan). What happens next in intermingling of male protagonists and their female leads is what Wrong No. is all about. Performance wise, Wrong No. depends mainly upon the shoulders of its greatly ensemble supporting cast. Javed Sheikh is a treat to watch, especially his expressions and one liners would keep audiences smiling and laughing at one point or the other during the entire movie. Nayyar Ejaz (Gullu Butt) is a revelation. Although his character has very limited screen presence but as they say a strong actor does not need lengthy role to impress his viewers. He cannot go ""unnoticed"". Danish Nawaz and Nadeem Jafry are good in their respective characters. Danish is very entertaining and it's his highest leap from what he usually does on television screens. Danish has the accurate talent for movies, particularly comic ones. Nadeem Jafri does not have many dialogues but his presence is very strong and some of his dialogues will be repeated by viewers. Danish Taimoor, the male lead of Wrong No., does not impress. This was a perfect role for any actor to nail it because it offers all drama, comedy, romance and dance. He needs to improve his dancing big time. There are two sentimental and dramatic scenes in the movie which center him and he looks fatigued in them. As far as his comic dialogues are concerned, it's the dialogue which will make the audiences laugh  not the way he has delivered them. Janita Asma needs to improve her acting skills, period. Sohai Ali Abro carries a huge baggage of Pyarey Afzal's Yasmeen's character. She performs like the same she did in that drama. Shafqat Cheema is average. Yasir Nawaz in a cameo is good. Tooba Siddiqui in a song is an eye candy. One special mention for the kid is the must. There's no way audience could ever stop laughing or forget his dialogues, expressions and plea. The kid is very very cute. As director, Yasir Nawaz has impressed and Wrong No. being his directorial debut makes him stand in the queue of dependable and able directors. Movie's songs are good, not great. Wrong No. is a laugh riot, thanks to the supportive cast to make that impactful. At the box office, Wrong No. will be a huge success and the reason is quite simple it's mindless comedy. Leave your brain at home or outside the theater when you plan to watch it. I would rate is 3.5 out of 5.",0
Wrong Number,"A perfect release for the joyous occasion of Eid. Wrong Number upstaged biggies from Lollywood (Bin Roye), Bollywood (Bajrangi Bhai Jaan) and Hollywood (Antman) and emerged as the surprise leader of the movies released during the extended Eid Holidays. The script is mindless but comedy is generally first rate and pace is fast. References to country's and especially Karachi's unique problems are numerous and delightful. ""Khaal sirf bhai logon ko jayegi ..."".The scene of child and the barber is hilarious. Music is a definite weak link so is the back ground score. A refreshing entertainer which continues the revival of Pakistani cinema.",4
Wrong Number,"A traditional Pakistani movie with lame jokes combined and weak plot. Yes, the movie is nothing but a twisted version of any 90s era of Bollywood movie, with lead character playing double role, a rich and a poor man. The acting of all the lead male and female except Javed Shaikh is literally unbearable. And yes, it's better to watch Nadaaniyaan than spending money on buying a ticket, because the sitcom by the producers of the movie is far more better. Danish Taimor, Janita Asma and Soha all were terrible (unless you can stand mindless comedy). The movie show cleavage, flirting and romancing even when its completely unnecessary only to add some ""Masala."" Had it been a Bollywood movie, it would have been rated as a B grade movie. One piece of advice for the director, next time don't just put new clothes on every character, it tells viewer how fake the movie is. Only watch this movie, if you have nothing to do in this world.",2
Wrong Number,"Not really liked, old and traditional story like bollywood,",3
Wrong Number,"Well Well Well, I must say the film was average,but yeah; it was much more then i expected it to be.1st of all,the story is pretty much old ghissi pitti.The same plot has been used in plenty of movies. If you are a story person, Wrong Number offers you nothing new. If only for entertainment, A few comedy kicks, funny familial issues and most of all the Essence of Karachi is what this movie offer you.Regarding Cast; Previously,i thought that no actor in todays lollywood league has the ability to lead in big-screen alone(excluding a few), but i was wrong, Danish Taimoor got the guts to capture and run the movie by his name, and convince population to watch the the movie for his sake. Still, he got to sharpen his acting skills,he was good in Jalaibi and in Wrong Number, but i think he has much more potential.Javed Shiekh,no doubt is a brilliant actor.He merged in the role of Karachi Bhayyia, sarcastically with character of a butcher & a hardcore father. His way of handling family matters with plenty of awesome comedy punches is what i liked the most.I think there was no need of the underworld characters other then Shafqat Cheema, he alone could have done the role much betterly, the remaining underworld cast kinda screwed his bad-guy singularity.The female leads were fine,but i think they could have cast better actresses. Yes these girls are pretty, but none of them knows how to act.What i liked was the acting, dialogs & accent of few characters. Overall, wrong number is a good one time watch. As a supporter of Pakistani cinema, i recommend you to watch it.",3
Wrong Number,"I recently watch this movie, I should say the director of the movie did a great job. One of the good movies produced by Pakistan. Actors did a brilliant job. Pakistan movies were not generally did good in the past, But here it is a new life in Pakistan film industry. Although there are some words that refer some idiot actors of Bollywood are not actually well appreciated but in the end it was a good movie. Songs are good and well performed. Movie starts with great Pakistan anthem and well appreciated. One of the best thing about this movie is, it is not longer movie like 3 hr. I should recommend my friends to watch this good movie that really make you happy.",5
Wrong Number,"First up, I have to confess I'm not your typical Urdu movie watcher. I'm a white British guy who just happens to love Bollywood films.I went with my wife to see this and we both laughed out loud at various bits. I thought the storyline was good; lighthearted and filled with opportunities for a laugh. One of the other reviewers says it was predictable, which I find odd. What exactly are they expecting. It's good old fashioned comedy not high drama.The acting was, on the whole, excellent. Yes, there was a little over-acting from some people, but that just added to the fun.Seeing the movie through Western eyes did make me feel there was quite a lot of male chauvinism, particularly how the father treat his wife and the respect he didn't show for his daughter in law, and I was a little taken a back that a suicide bomber could be used in such a humorous way, but on reflection, I figure this was, in some ways a cultural reference that was lost on me.I've given it a 7/10 and I feel it definitely deserves that.

Wrong Number,"I had a wonderful time watch this one. Had a good laugh and managed to enjoy every scene. The story does leave a lot to be desired and you can sense that it is ultimately inspired from many Bollywood films, but I didn't mind that as long as it managed to entertain, which it did to no ends.The one who completely stole the show and was the funniest was Javed Sheikh. His scenes at home, amidst his family, the little kid, and especially the scenes where the daughter-in-law constantly interrupts him, were just gold. The film was full of wordplay and double-meaned sentences, was hence my type of comedy.So thinking that it is a Pakistani film after all, I wouldn't want to point out too many flaws. I won't only say it exceeded my expectation, but was in fact easily the best comedy to come from Pakistan from the ones that I have watched.",4
Wrong Number,Such a bad film. Thank God I didn't watch it in cinema. It's a torture. Lousy script and bad comedy. A pain to watch. Such a terrible film,1
Wrong Number,"Well I watched it twice just because it was a light and funny movie, no need to pay for movies where you sit and cry, i prefer pay and laugh scenarios. I think director have nailed it what they wanted to produce they have produced, the movie was made to make people laugh and it does just that. There are no serious moment in the movie and Pakistani people have enough seriousness to worry about when they step back in the real world. Sit back and laugh a little and watch this movie without high expectations. You will enjoy it. Some jokes are a little over the top but hey we watch way too bigger crap in Hollywood and Bollywood movies. Supporting Pakistani Cinema all the way.",5
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"Just when I think Pakistani movies are heading in the right direction they come up with stuff like this.""If you can't beat them, join them"", this was what Mr and Mrs Nawaz thought after watching a modern Bollywood comedy and they probably said to their selves, ""why can't we get away with this, Sajid Khan did, and it's not like the people in Pakistan have any more sense then those in India. Why go through the effort of building an entire film when you can just get a cheap script, fill it with dirty humor and two item songs and we have ourselves 130 minutes of utter nonsense"" and that's when they decided to make this piece of crap they so proudly call a movie.This movie has nothing going for it, the plot, the acting, the screenplay, the direction, nothing is worth mentioning and there was absolutely no character development or chemistry whatsoever in fact I've seen cave paintings with better stories than this movie.Coming back to the inappropriate jokes/scenes, two families with little kids walked out of the theater halfway through the movie. If this is Nida Yasir's idea of a family film after years of doing a morning show then God help us.Last year it was Na Maloom Afraad and now this, these ""commercial movies"" aren't really aiding the resurrection of Lollywood, they're just stabbing it in the face with a blunt knife.",1
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"(Spoilers Ahead) What's the sure-shot way to launch a blockbuster at the box office, when there's an intersection of a festival and long weekend? Create a masala entertainer, market it on (literally) every platform and get loads and loads of business. Well, that's exactly what YNH (Yasir Nawaz, Nida Yasir and Hassan Zia) Films did. Wrong No. is one of the most hyped movies of this year, produced in Pakistan. Yasir and Nida have produced Nadaaniaan (a TV Sitcom) that gained massive popularity. One can only expect mega dose of laughter and entertainment from their first movie. Danish Taimoor, after Jalaibee needed a performance to save his career in the Pakistani movie industry. Javed Sheikh is has proved yet again that his comic timing is among the finest ones in the industry after Na Maloom Afraad's huge success. Would Wrong No. be able to do great business at the box office? Will it be a turning point for the main leads? Let's explore! Wrong No. starts with Sallu (Danish) running away from his home because his father Haji Abba (a butcher by profession) wants him to get married with Laila (Sohai Ali Abro) and join him in his business either of which Sallu doesn't want. Sallu plans to sneak in the empire of Sheharyar (Sallu's look alike). Shehryar visits Pakistan for the first time and his subordinate Haya (Janita Asma) visits Karachi from Lahore to take him to Lahore. On the contrary, Shera (Shafqat Cheema) and Danish Nawaz both want to abduct Sheharyar to get ransom from his grandfather who is a Nawab (Qavi Khan). What happens next in intermingling of male protagonists and their female leads is what Wrong No. is all about. Performance wise, Wrong No. depends mainly upon the shoulders of its greatly ensemble supporting cast. Javed Sheikh is a treat to watch, especially his expressions and one liners would keep audiences smiling and laughing at one point or the other during the entire movie. Nayyar Ejaz (Gullu Butt) is a revelation. Although his character has very limited screen presence but as they say a strong actor does not need lengthy role to impress his viewers. He cannot go ""unnoticed"". Danish Nawaz and Nadeem Jafry are good in their respective characters. Danish is very entertaining and it's his highest leap from what he usually does on television screens. Danish has the accurate talent for movies, particularly comic ones. Nadeem Jafri does not have many dialogues but his presence is very strong and some of his dialogues will be repeated by viewers. Danish Taimoor, the male lead of Wrong No., does not impress. This was a perfect role for any actor to nail it because it offers all drama, comedy, romance and dance. He needs to improve his dancing big time. There are two sentimental and dramatic scenes in the movie which center him and he looks fatigued in them. As far as his comic dialogues are concerned, it's the dialogue which will make the audiences laugh  not the way he has delivered them. Janita Asma needs to improve her acting skills, period. Sohai Ali Abro carries a huge baggage of Pyarey Afzal's Yasmeen's character. She performs like the same she did in that drama. Shafqat Cheema is average. Yasir Nawaz in a cameo is good. Tooba Siddiqui in a song is an eye candy. One special mention for the kid is the must. There's no way audience could ever stop laughing or forget his dialogues, expressions and plea. The kid is very very cute. As director, Yasir Nawaz has impressed and Wrong No. being his directorial debut makes him stand in the queue of dependable and able directors. Movie's songs are good, not great. Wrong No. is a laugh riot, thanks to the supportive cast to make that impactful. At the box office, Wrong No. will be a huge success and the reason is quite simple it's mindless comedy. Leave your brain at home or outside the theater when you plan to watch it. I would rate is 3.5 out of 5.",0
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"A perfect release for the joyous occasion of Eid. Wrong Number upstaged biggies from Lollywood (Bin Roye), Bollywood (Bajrangi Bhai Jaan) and Hollywood (Antman) and emerged as the surprise leader of the movies released during the extended Eid Holidays. The script is mindless but comedy is generally first rate and pace is fast. References to country's and especially Karachi's unique problems are numerous and delightful. ""Khaal sirf bhai logon ko jayegi ..."".The scene of child and the barber is hilarious. Music is a definite weak link so is the back ground score. A refreshing entertainer which continues the revival of Pakistani cinema.",4
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"A traditional Pakistani movie with lame jokes combined and weak plot. Yes, the movie is nothing but a twisted version of any 90s era of Bollywood movie, with lead character playing double role, a rich and a poor man. The acting of all the lead male and female except Javed Shaikh is literally unbearable. And yes, it's better to watch Nadaaniyaan than spending money on buying a ticket, because the sitcom by the producers of the movie is far more better. Danish Taimor, Janita Asma and Soha all were terrible (unless you can stand mindless comedy). The movie show cleavage, flirting and romancing even when its completely unnecessary only to add some ""Masala."" Had it been a Bollywood movie, it would have been rated as a B grade movie. One piece of advice for the director, next time don't just put new clothes on every character, it tells viewer how fake the movie is. Only watch this movie, if you have nothing to do in this world.",2
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"Not really liked, old and traditional story like bollywood,",3
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"Well Well Well, I must say the film was average,but yeah; it was much more then i expected it to be.1st of all,the story is pretty much old ghissi pitti.The same plot has been used in plenty of movies. If you are a story person, Wrong Number offers you nothing new. If only for entertainment, A few comedy kicks, funny familial issues and most of all the Essence of Karachi is what this movie offer you.Regarding Cast; Previously,i thought that no actor in todays lollywood league has the ability to lead in big-screen alone(excluding a few), but i was wrong, Danish Taimoor got the guts to capture and run the movie by his name, and convince population to watch the the movie for his sake. Still, he got to sharpen his acting skills,he was good in Jalaibi and in Wrong Number, but i think he has much more potential.Javed Shiekh,no doubt is a brilliant actor.He merged in the role of Karachi Bhayyia, sarcastically with character of a butcher & a hardcore father. His way of handling family matters with plenty of awesome comedy punches is what i liked the most.I think there was no need of the underworld characters other then Shafqat Cheema, he alone could have done the role much betterly, the remaining underworld cast kinda screwed his bad-guy singularity.The female leads were fine,but i think they could have cast better actresses. Yes these girls are pretty, but none of them knows how to act.What i liked was the acting, dialogs & accent of few characters. Overall, wrong number is a good one time watch. As a supporter of Pakistani cinema, i recommend you to watch it.",3
Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"I recently watch this movie, I should say the director of the movie did a great job. One of the good movies produced by Pakistan. Actors did a brilliant job. Pakistan movies were not generally did good in the past, But here it is a new life in Pakistan film industry. Although there are some words that refer some idiot actors of Bollywood are not actually well appreciated but in the end it was a good movie. Songs are good and well performed. Movie starts with great Pakistan anthem and well appreciated. One of the best thing about this movie is, it is not longer movie like 3 hr.

Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nai Hoti,"First up, I have to confess I'm not your typical Urdu movie watcher. I'm a white British guy who just happens to love Bollywood films.I went with my wife to see this and we both laughed out loud at various bits. I thought the storyline was good; lighthearted and filled with opportunities for a laugh. One of the other reviewers says it was predictable, which I find odd. What exactly are they expecting. It's good old fashioned comedy not high drama.The acting was, on the whole, excellent. Yes, there was a little over-acting from some people, but that just added to the fun.Seeing the movie through Western eyes did make me feel there was quite a lot of male chauvinism, particularly how the father treat his wife and the respect he didn't show for his daughter in law, and I was a little taken a back that a suicide bomber could be used in such a humorous way, but on reflection, I figure this was, in some ways a cultural reference that was lost on me.I've given it a 7/10 and I feel it definitely deserves that. I would definitely go see another Urdu film on the back of this one.",4

BaBo,"This movie was great! Lots of comedy, lots of emotional scenes, and the girls were cute. The story is also unique, its about sibling love as opposed to all the other romances about relationships and sex. Ha Ji-won was hot, as always. The dude from My Sassy Girl was also great, he played an idiot pretty convincingly, haha. The stories intertwined well together, and the ending didn't really upset either. The only gripe I had in this entire movie is how they dragged on some of the scenes. I know the fool liked to repeat stuff over and over again, but when the people of normal intelligence were doing it too, it seemed fake and over-dramatic. Overall a great film though.",5
BaBo,"BA:BO is a 2008 film based closely on a popular webcomic by Kang Full. While the film does contain some comedy, it tells a much deeper story than any of Cha Tae-hyun's other films. I would even say that the film is purely an emotional drama with only mere hints of romance and slight humor. In BA:BO, Ji-ho (Ha Ji-won) returns home after studying and playing the piano in Europe for over ten years. She left Europe because of the frustration that came with an instance of stage fright. Back in her hometown, she meets her mentally challenged, childhood friend, Seung-ryong (Cha Tae-hyun), who runs a small toast shop in order to take care of his younger sister, Ji-in (Park Ha-sun), who unfortunately despises him. Along with Seung-ryong's best friend, Sang-soo (Park Hee- soon), and Hee-yeong (Park Grina), the characters all suffer life problems of their own. It is the village idiot, Seung-ryong, who heals and saves them all.Ji-ho and Sang-soo's interaction with Seung-ryong evokes pity and nostalgic sympathy. Due to a misunderstanding, Sang-soo's guilt as a child drew him close to Seung-ryong as a true friend. Ji-ho on the other hand, was admired by Seung-ryong ever since they were little due to her piano playing that, according to Seung-ryong, would cause snow to fall and stars to appear. It is sweet and a bit sad to see Ha Ji-won's character treat Seung-ryong so nicely because of his innocent mind. While he genuinely likes her, she finds comfort and strength when she looks after him. The film tells a story that really can only be fully understood by reading the expressions and actions of the actors. And it is those actions that can cause the viewer to get a bit teary eyed here and there throughout the film.Speaking of actors, Cha Tae-hyun plays his role as the hardworking, village idiot so convincingly. And he does so with his own style  his signature goofy smile adds so much authenticity to his character's innocence. He really is one of the best actors in Korea. Ha Ji-won impressed me as well, considering that this is one of her first works that I've seen where she isn't type-casted as a cutesy love interest. The slight, emotional changes that her character experiences can be seen thanks to her superb acting, despite the limits that the script has for her character. All the other actors were great as well, besides Park Ha- sun in one scene towards the end of the film  while the scene evokes grievous emotion, it appears questionably forced.It is fascinating how the individual stories of each character seem separate, but all converge in the end. And it is that result that really makes the viewer sit back and think how people, no matter how smart or talented, can affect the lives and happiness of those nearby. BA:BO is a touching film that stays with the viewer well after the ending credits. I highly recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a fan of Korean dramas.",4
Andolan,"After Sanju's imprisonment, several of his films remained incomplete, ANDOLAN(1995) was one of them, The film was almost complete but since Sanju in jail he couldn't finish the dubbing which was dubbed by Chetan Shashital who dubbed for him in several films like Jai Vikraanta, Namak.etc while one song of Sanju was shot on Govinda. The film paired Sanju and Govinda after Taaqatwar and Do Qaidi in the 80s and Jeete Hai Shaan Se. ANDOLAN has an oft.repeated story which is nothing new, the film does have some good dramatic moments, though but nothing out of the ordinary. The film starts with romance,comedy and college scenes like in 90s which hardly appeals, the twist in the story too looks heckeyened Sanju-Govinda clash similar to DEEWAAR does have it's moments yet nothing out of the ordinary. The film has several hard to digest action scenes like in those days, like Sanju coming out of the mud to beat Rami Reddy, also there are several clichs.Direction by Ajiz Sajawal is ordinary Music is decent, Nadeem Shravan give some good melodies Dil To Khoya Hai is a good song,rest are decent tooSanjay Dutt does his role well, however as his voice is dubbed the impact is not as it should be, the dubbing just doesn't sound like his, the film was started in 1992 though in the film there are hardly visible change in hairstyles(something a norm in his those days films) Govinda does his role well, he plays serious roles too well their chemistry is good here, however things changed with their next film Haseena Maan Jayegi which released few years after this film. Somy Ali is a non actress, Mamta Kulkarni is okay Amongst villains Rami Reddy is wooden as always, Mohan Joshi, Dalip Tahil are all as usual Vikram Gokhale is decent, Asha Parekh leaves an impact IShrat Ali is good, rest are okay",2
Kidnap,"I love action movies without aliens and superheroes so I was exited to see this movie where Halle Berry goes all out in her attempts to safe her kid. The base of the story isn't that bad but oh how I hate it when writers can't come up with logical behavior even in high pressure situations.With a little bit more creativity this actually could have been a very decent movie, but they took the easy way and at times it just was annoying how the story developed.So a big disappointment.",3
Kidnap,"Not really even sure where to start. We'll go through the low points blow by blow.Storyline - there isn't one. The entire plot makes no sense, and is so ridiculous as to have you laughing out loud for most of the movie. Yeah kid gets kidnapped and mother will stop at nothing to get him back. Seen that before. But what you've not seen is the utter drivel they come up with in this movie. Utter garbage dressed up as some kind of action. It's the worst story I've seen in as long as I can remember. I haven't even got to the end yet, and I'm writing this.Acting - woeful beyond belief. Halle Berry would have to have been utterly desperate to get involved with this garbage. Minutes of talking to herself about how she won't let her kid go, all while in the middle of a car chase. Obviously the part is written and there's not much she can do about the story line, but unless she needs the money, she'd just walk away. No idea why she's even involved.Action - appalling. 'High-speed' stunts filmed at about 5km/h, then sped up to seem faster. Non-sensical action scenes that add nothing other than further ridicule to this movie.Cinematography - I can't say I've ever seen anything as laughably appalling as this. During the 'high-speed' chases, we get minutes worth of tyre-going-around footage, interspersed with minutes of yellow lines on the road. We get it - they're driving.Overall this movie is atrocious and simply not worth your time. Unless you want to spend a couple hours yelling at the TV to get her to actually do something towards getting her son back. Abysmal, appalling, ghastly garbage.",1
Kidnap,"I saw this because I like Halley Berry movies and figured that this would be another good movie. I was horribly wrong.The plot has too many holes and makes no sense whatsoever.After many miles of ""chasing"" the kidnappers she finally thinks to ram into them once her van is almost out of gas? Did she think to do this when they were stuck in traffic or while surrounded by cars on the highway? Or maybe when there was a cop following her?Nope, she waits until they are on a deserted road.When the kidnapper comes after her with a shotgun, where does the genius hide? In her mini van with wrap around windows. Good thing the bad guy decides not to shoot out the glass and shoot her.Finally we get near the end of this horrible movie and the woman kidnapper sicks a dog on the Halley Berry and her kid. Somehow after killing the kidnapper the dog mysteriously disappears and never shows up again.Possibly the dog was as board with this movie as the audience and simply gave up to do something better.These are not the only horrible parts of the movie, but the most glaring.It's an hour and half of my life that I wish that I could get back. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews, this is a horrible movie and should be skipped.",1
Kidnap,"I normally wouldn't write a spoiler for a review, but I find it necessary to pick this movie apart piece by piece 'cos the story was a load of Bull. First of all, I'm not sure which pisses me off more, the script writer that left so many holes in the story or the main character which Halle Berry played quite well. Suffice to say, while I find Halle's acting to be believable, I find the personality of the character she played quite confusing and unappealing. I really couldn't help disliking her and her choices from the beginning of the movie till the very end. I thought, ""well, how stupid can she get"" every five minutes. And here is why.1. Why didn't she slam into the kidnappers' car when she had the chance at the stop light? I would think adrenaline was pumping at that moment the incidence just occurred and some more desperate howbeit reckless attempt would have been made to recover the boy.2. It took her so long to get on the phone and call the cops while chasing the car that had her son. Really?! And don't tell us she lost her phone. All you need to do to attract the police in all 50 states is to rear end or side swipe a few cars and keep going. They will do the calling for you. She didn't as much as bash any other vehicle during the first half of the ""desperate"" chase.3. She was driving like my granny. 4. The scene where a cop on a motorcycle attempted to pull her over was just so silly. All she had to was keep going when the cop asked her to pull over till he called it in and had other cops on the chase. well, another scene that made this character seem like an idiot.5. So she offered up her financial instruments and didn't think to keep the pin as bargaining chip till she was at the point of ensuring an exchange then went ahead to let the kidnapper into her car... Not beside her, behind her. Then drove to a secluded highway. Why on earth would the kidnapper that has your son, your cards, your pin, keep you alive when the only thing keeping you from reporting the cards stolen is being alive? Is this character just daft or these is how people actually react when they are in crisis?6. She overpowers and throws out a woman twice her size, positioned behind her while she is driving and being strangled at the same time out of a moving mini-van. All the while with door closed. The only script allowed to have that sort of impractical scenario is a James Bond movie. Absolutely unbelievable. The woman also came into her vehicle with no phones on her with which to alert her ""boyfriend"" when she was tossed from the car?7. She actually stopped a stranger from getting run over by putting her vehicle between said stranger and a car about to run him over at a time she had the option of intercepting the kidnapper about to get away with her son. I believe natural instinct is self preservation before all else except a person has specific training to react otherwise in those circumstances. When i saw this scene, it didn't make her out to be a hero to me, I just felt she must not be trying to save her son.8. It took her almost an hour into the movie after driving Miss Daisy behind the kidnappers for her to realize she could rear end the car... guess what? Right about the time the car was running empty on gas. *roll my eyes*9. The kidnappers were painted not as newbies, but repeat offenders who did this for a living. Well, it didn't look like it. If they were pros, they had every opportunity to take the boy across state lines while the mum was taking a ""cruise"" around town.10. Then there is the question of how the boy made it from the car with the male kidnapper to the house where the kids were being kept. One moment, the boy is in the car with the male kidnapper being chased by the mum in distress, the next moment, the mum is asking ""where is my son?"" and she's fishing for an ID on the kidnapper's lifeless body. #Sheish!11. Kidnappers' Den. She sees a sawn off shotgun lying on a table and she leaves it. Really?! She's anti-gun? 12. The boat ploy was also dumb. If she could fool the woman, she couldn't fool a dog for a second. The dog would have gone for the water immediately and started barking not after she had fired off a few rounds into an empty boat which un-propelled was able to move away from a powerful flashlight that fast? Errmmm! Really?So I guess the only thing you could consider smart about the main character was the fact that she was able to pick up on the ""neighbour's"" lie? Psssssh! The main character was not properly developed and profiled. First acting conservative and unsure of what to do then later switching to aggressive, alpha personality. Every other thing that occurred in this plot was pure luck and stupidity on the kidnappers part. Well, I didn't see any well calculated attempt at recovering the child. The script is weak and empty. So thumbs down. I lost empathy for her and felt like smacking a head all though the movie maybe to knock a little sense into her. She should be loosing custody after this episode.",1
Kidnap,"Warning Spoilers!This main character is so damn stupid. Beyond any reasonable logic. When she had a chance to kill the man who took her son, she didn't. When it's time for some cool stunt driving scenes, the highway is full of cars. Other times when she is just following the kidnappers car, there isn't a single car on the entire highway or 10 minutes! It's just to aggravating to watch a lead character who makes such stupid decisions just to further the film. The stupidity continues throughout the film.I wish someone would have kidnapped me before I started to watch this film. Avoid it.",1
Kidnap,"I've never yelled at a movie more than this. I literally made an account to tell anyone how bad this film is. No one acts like this if their kid is taken, she doesn't hit the car, she doesn't hit the people that took her kid. She had multiple chances to do so. Whoever wrote this script and directed this movie should never be able to work on a set ever again.",1
Kidnap,"This was so bad that I logged into IMDb to learn who was responsible for this rubbish posing as a movie. It was Luis Prieto and I will make very sure that I never bother with anything that he is associated with in the future. Beginning with the ludicrously over-long series of images of babies that bored me and imagine many others, it morphed into rambling and unnecessary nonsense that added nothing to the plot. I suffered through another thirty minutes or so hoping for improvement then turned the movie off in disgust. It lacks coherence, logic, a basic plot, and skill with imagery. BORING INANE BANAL are descriptors that jump to mind.",1
Kidnap,"How this movie received 6.4 stars is beyond me The trailer looked awesome, as usual they show you the good bits, Halle Berry's acting is really substandard, anyone in there right mind would not have acted in the same way she did. The car chase scenes are very disappointing, the director should have put a little more thought into the acting, car chases and story line. The movie left me feeling really frustrated with majority of her actions, the last time i felt this way was after watching Jeepers Creepers. Lets do all the wrong things for the sake of it to make an entertaining movie 1 star - utter garbage",1
Kidnap,"Absolutely horrible movie. Don't waste your money or your time. The mom had multiple opportunities to ram the car with her kid in it, trapping the car, in relatively safe areas, and did not. Then she didn't run over the kidnappers when she had the opportunity? She actually let one in her car??!!!! Wtf? And she CAN'T drive. Who the hell drives with their arms fully extended and elbows locked? Then her conversations with herself are just ludicrous. She's constantly changing her clothes while driving. Gives her wallet, with her address, credit cards, and cash to the kidnappers, so I guess she won't need gas money and wants them to know where she lives. If this is modeled after an actual event, the mother is an absolute idiot and custody should go to the father, because he can't be any dumber. Just totally painful to watch. I left the theatre.",1
Kidnap,"I have never laughed more at a movie that was intended to be an emotional thriller. I have also never yelled the word ""idiot"" so often. Halle Berry displayed all the traits of a moron right from the beginning which probably set the tone for most of her actions throughout. We had hope that she'd at least do us all a favor and place the girls on display. It would have guaranteed 2 extra stars. *spoiler* she remained fully clothed.After the first 30mins of mental torture, we only continued watching in the hope that they would beat her up and poke her with pitchforks. My friends held posters cheering on the bad guys.I have also never seen anyone look so determined in a car chase at 20-40mph. They should have swapped the minivan for an 18 wheeler to match her facial expressions. I'm convinced grandmothers could drive faster with gunny bags over their heads.The only way this movie would enter an awards event is if the award for the biggest dumass was up for grabs. Judging by most reviews on here, it's a sure thing.The part that hurt the most was that we paid to watch this...",1
Kidnap,"This is the worst recreation of a parents actions to a kidnapping. Her thoughtlessness got him kidnapped, there's no reason she faced the way she did. I had my kid at parks and playgrounds, but you can still keep an eye out. Sure kids can wander away, but this wasn't the case, it was all her. Then her bad pursuit got them to get away, there's reviews that stated she didn't stop the kidnapper car cause they showed her a (spoiler) knife!! She was right behind them on a slow moving ramp, she has a van pull in front of them and block them. The knife scene was much later. Don't she know how to use a van. Her frantic actions were understandable but the way she pulled it off was pathetic, the writing was really bad. People without common sense would enjoy this.",1
Kidnap,"Kidnap tells the story of Karla Dyson, who on a summer day the local park together with her son Frankie to blow of some steam and strengthen their mother-son bond. However disaster strikes when Frankie is kidnapped from under everyone's noses. Before all hope is lost Karla is able to catch a glimpse of a man and a women forcing Frankie into their car. The kidnappers quickly make their escape, however what they don't know is that they have chosen the wrong person to mess with as Karla wills top at nothing to recover her lost son.If this small synopsis got you excited please curb your enthusiasm as this pretty much describes the entire movie. Right from the start it is clear that the movie itself is as generic as the title would suggest. The first act is a very obvious attempt at establishing the mother- son bond such that we as an audience actually care about what happens to Frankie. This is executed so poorly however that it almost reaches an adverse effect and kind of makes you wish Frankie gets kidnapped. When this finally does happen the movie turns into a weird action movie that goes on for what feels like an eternity. When the movie finally reaches its conclusion it does so in an incredibly predicting manner and throughout the film there are no interesting twists to the story.Most of the action in the movie comes from a very long chase scene in the middle of the film. This sequence is however not very riveting since it is very obvious Karla will eventually catch up with the kidnappers because otherwise the movie would just end then and there. During these scenes the writers felt it necessary for Karla to spell out what is happening, often she would scream ""They've got my baby"" or ""My son is in that car"". It's about as stupid as it sounds and these are just a few examples. As much as Karla cares about her son as little does she seem to care about others, while chasing her kidnappers she causes many traffic accidents for instance when she is backing up on a highway where people are driving at 100 km/h. She must have caused the death or at the very least severe injury of many innocent people, however everyone seems to forget this when everyone calls her a 'true American hero' after she, spoiler warning, saves her son from the kidnappers.Kidnap is directed by Luis Prieto who makes a lot of weird creative decisions throughout. The chase sequences for instance are intercut with several aerial views of the two cars driving along the highway. These shots often go on for what feels like several minutes in what appears to be an attempt to pad the movies runtime. This was obviously necessary since the movie just barely exceeds Hollywood's' self- imposed 90 minute minimum, however it still manages to outstay it's welcome and bores halfway through. Furthermore Prieto never tries to make the movie visually interesting and hardly puts any focus on the emotional side of things as the only emotion Karla shows is anger, she never seems desperate or afraid.Halle Berry, the actress portraying Karla also hardly appear to put in any effort. Kidnap by far marks her worst performance of those I've seen and if this is representative of her future work then I really hope her role in the new Kingsman movie is limited to only a few scenes. However considering her multiple Golden Globes nominations and even an Academy Award win I really think that his terrible performance has more to do with the source material not giving her anything to really work with. Halle Berry for me is an actress that is best suited in the supporting category while in Kidnap she is on her own monologuing most of the time.Kidnap is by far the worst movie of the year up until now. The acting is terrible, the story is bland and predictable and nothing interesting is happening on the screen. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, however if you really want to know the story of Karla and Frankie then watch the trailer instead and save yourself 90 costly minutes of your life.My rating: 1/10",1
Kidnap,"First of all, I saw Kidnap at a sneakpreview in The Netherlands. This means nobody knows which movie title they are going to see and you get a very diverse audience. The thing I noticed while filling out my rating form was that my form was the 9th one with a 1 filled in.Ok, the movie. It's bad most of the movie is a car chase at ""high"" speed :-) The car of the main character even gets overtaken by 2 trucks/lorries. The main character gets about a 1000 different possibilities to stop the car witth her son in it in front of others but never does.Somehow she does find it important to take off her sweater during the chase (if I would do that in that situation I would crash:)But enough about this movie, I want to forget I ever saw it. Be warned, stay away!Ps.. There is a reason why you don't hear allot about Halle Berry anymore.... (bad acting could be one)",1
Kidnap,"Typical of an American movie where the most important emphasis is put on car chasing and people who have at least, like a cat, SEVEN lives. Come on!......please.... I fail to understand why Hale would accept playing in such a movie. She definitely has the talent to play in a much better and significant movie. Sorry!!!",1
Kidnap,"I'm baffled as to why there are bad reviews! 
I was close to a panic attack while watching this, had to pause and take some deep breaths. 
I think the bad reviews are from people who don't have children. 
If you have children, you will feel every emotion that mother went through. 
It was action packed and intense. 
Acting was outstanding, yeah there were a few cheesy lines from Ms Berry but hey this was her script and her character. 
Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me",5
Kidnap,"Can Halle Berry's Oscar be revoked? This is the absolute worst acting I have seen by an Oscar winner ever. She is horrible in this movie then top it off with the worst plot and screen writing. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. There is nothing that makes any sense, there are more holes in this plot than a tennis racket. Save yourself some time and avoid this movie at all costs. Shame shame shame.",1
Kidnap,"Truly shocking for people blindly following the words of critics. This is really a good film. I totally enjoyed it. Well, it was not like I never saw such film. In a century of motion picture history, hundreds of similar films were made. This is just another one, but there's nothing wrong with it. People wrongly judged it. The pace of the film was rocket speed. So basically, there's no time for one to keep looking for flaws. If they do, then they're not enjoying the show. They missed out everything, hence end up bashing it. Just like the clowns, aka film critics.It was another kidnap film that Halle Barry in it, that's similar to her previous film 'The Call'. It did not take long to get into the action. A hardworking mother, going through divorce, fighting for her son's custody. While engaging in a phone call, she loses her son in an amusement park. The alert mother quickly jumps into pursuing when he was seen forcefully taken in a stranger's car. The remaining events take place on the road, with car chases, with a twist before the conclusion.Nicely written screenplay and well performed actors, particularly Halle Berry. I have never seen she had played such an energetic role in the recent time. Whatever the storyline is, it's kind of an inspiring film. How a mother fought for her son. Totally a mother instinct. You can't simply expect like the film 'Taken'. It might not be realistic, but cinematically honest. The same thing happens in the animal world too. Sad that the film released after so many delays. Moreover, how people responded to it. Believe me, it is a nice film and I definitely suggest it to all.8/10",4
Kidnap,"I watch a lot of movies. I travel for work so the majority of my time is spent on planes and in hotel rooms. I'd say I watch around 4 or 5 films each week, and with almost every one I go to IMDb first to see the user reviews. This is the first review I've ever left on IMDb, and that's because this movie was so infuriating, I felt I would be letting down the other IMDb users that have been there for me so many times in the past. Kidnap is without question the WORST piece of work that Halle Berry has ever been a part of. The trailer and plot gave me hope of something entertaining, and at times it was. However, about 20 minutes into it, I turned to my wife and screamed in rage because of how implausible certain aspect of this movie are. There are so many parts where all you can do is place your hands on your head and think to yourself, ""are they being serious right now??"" Halle did as good of a job as you could hope with such a ridiculous script, but honestly no one could've saved this monstrosity. If you have plenty of time like I do to watch films, check it out and see for yourself. If you're one of those people who can only squeeze in one movie a month, please don't waste your time. It's just going to end up upsetting you.",1
Kidnap,I think Halle Berry did great in Kidnap. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat and trust me there is never a dull moment. Plus the movie is not predictable so that's a plus! Don't Listen to all the kidnap haters and not watch the movie. I think you should watch the movie and judge for yourself whether it is a good movie or not. People have different opinions and you might actually like the movie. Just Give It A Chance!!!!!,5
Kidnap,"I really loved this movie... every minute is thrill with a good story! You can relate to the characters. Halle's acting is again breathtaking. I really don't understand why some users have negative comments about this movie. I gave it 10 out of 10, because it does justice to its genre.Thriller movie lovers should definitely see it.",5
Kidnap,The trailer and the story convinced me so far that I had to buy this DVD. And I didn't regret it because it is a real nail biter that took even my breath away until the end. Halle Berry was perfect in this so emotional mother role. Kidnap is one of the rare movies that is better than all other average or bad movies that came out this year. If you want to spend a suspense evening give this a chance. Together with my wife I give a solid 7/10. If you like this genre of films don't miss Trapped or Panic Room.,4
Kidnap,"Halle's acting was superb, she really carried the intensity of the moment throughout. yes it should've been a little bit shorter but for this kind of movie I was entertained and on the edge of my seat for the most part. Oh and as someone who always forgets to charge my phone It didn't take suspension of belief for me to go along with how much trouble you can get into by not having a dang phone on you. I felt the morale of the film really is that you have to fight for your own, no one will care as much as you do.",5
Kidnap,"What does it take to make a good thriller? Suspense, to feel the tension, to give you the chills. And this movie did that in the right way! Don't get influenced by subjective people who walked of the movie after the first 10 minutes!If you love good flicks that give you goosebumps and mainly love thrillers, this is the perfect movie for you. Watching the trailer I was expecting mediocre movie, but what I got was way above that. It reminded me of another Halle Berry's thriller - The Call from 2013 which was very good too.I can't say it's a perfect film, it has it's flaws. There is only one ""what happened to that"" moment. You know, when some questions aren't answered, but it wasn't that big of a deal at all.Halle Berry's stellar and compelling performance definitely sells the character of a suffering mother trying to safe her kid's life. The other actors did pretty good job too.The film pushes the right buttons to make you feel the suspense in the whole run time. It surely deserves 10/10!",4
Kidnap,"This movie is nothing short of amazing. Given the situation I would have done the same thing like a bat out of Hell. Halle Berry gave an emotional and real performance. There are no clichs and you never knew what was happening next. There really isn't much left too say but, EXCELLENT!",5
Miracle,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.Kurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he's not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets' techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it. The only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks' wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She's been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?Certainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach's single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the ""do it for the Gipper"" silliness that has become a sports clich. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn't win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for.",4
Miracle,"'Miracles do happen', the announcer's original broadcast is heard during the scenes recreated for this movie, 'Miracle.' Anyone who remembers what happened during those Winter Olympics in 1980 will know what this movie is about, and how it ends. However, there can be no spoilers, because this is not a movie about a hockey game, or even the sport of hockey. Nor is it about the players. It is solely about the coach, Herb Brooks, who, with his unconventional style and wisdom about the game, took these young hockey players to a level no one thought possible. In the end it didn't really matter whether they won or lost the game against the Russian. What mattered was that each of the 20 players found out what was possible inside himself.The movie begins with a montage of scenes from the period, the years, leading up to the selection of the Olympic hockey team in the summer of 1979. The cold war. The oil shortage and long gasoline lines. The disgraced President Nixon. The embattled President Carter. The Russians invading Afganistan. Then we see coach Brooks doing it his own way. A year and a half of scouting, one day of try-outs, to pick the 26 players which would eventually be cut to 20 for the competition. The DVD extras show us how much went into making the movie faithful, including a session with Brooks himself, who died in an accident right after filming was wrapped up. A very fine movie of a very inspirational journey.",0
Miracle,"Don't let the fact that this is a Disney movie deter you from watching a thoroughly enjoyable and adult-level sports movie for two-plus hours. Kurt Russell does an excellent job portraying coach Herb Brooks as a complex and sometimes ruthless and inscrutable leader. Very UN-Disney-like indeed. I am not a hockey fan - in fact I dislike the game intensely - yet I enjoyed the well-crafted scenes of competitive team play. Knowing the outcome of the BIG GAME did not detract at all from the excitement and suspense surrounding it. Sort of like the suspense Ron Howard achieved in Apollo 13 (where we knew in advance the outcome, but were worried about and later relieved for our astronauts). A must-see for sports fans and non-fans alike.",4
Miracle,"I was wary at first of  Disney production of this film. I didn't want the cheesy Mighty Ducks type of sports movie, especially when dealing with the awesome task completed by these players. I thought the film makers did a nice job and the movie itself was quite entertaining. I think it exposes a whole generation to the 1980 U.S. hockey team and what they accomplished. Even though I am not a fan of Kurt Russell, I thought he was very good as Herb Brooks. He had the mannerisms and the voice down very well. Russell is a huge hockey fan himself so I know it was honor for him to play Brooks. For die hard hockey fans, this movie will entertain and it does not poison the game action or what it is really like to play hockey.",4
Miracle,"I am the child of two St. Paul east- siders.  My father has loved hockey for as long as he can remember.  My mom, well, she just likes sports in general. Hockey ruled my life from the very first moments.  First my father's practices and games, then my little brother, later on there were boyfriends, friends, high school, and college.  Now there is Gophers and Wild. I imagine that hockey will continue to define my life for a very long time.That said, for Minnesota kids there are legends told to them from the beginning.  How Paul Bunyan shaped our lakes and rivers, and lived ""Up North"", and there is Herb Brooks.  Legends that define Minnesota heritage.Herb Brooks was a man who shaped the way hockey is viewed in Minnesota.  A stand out at St. Paul Johnson High School, and at the U.  He went to coach his beloved Gophers and work with his idol John Mariucci.  Now the ice at Mariucci Arena (not 2 miles from where I sit now) bears tribute to Herby. His coaching techniques are still used and abused throughout the state.Kurt Russell paid apt tribute to our late leader, and I am positive he would be impressed.  I was fortunate enough to get sneak-preview tickets to see Miracle, and I can honestly say I don't remember when I had such a good time at the movies.  I don't think I stopped smiling once.  Russell's accent was good throughout the movie, but on just a few lines I could have SWORN that he was a Minnesotan.  He elongated his vowels very well.Eddie Cahill did a superb job as Jim Clark.  I wondered how exactly he would play someone so torn between immense sadness and undeniable pride. I was even more impressed with his hockey skills.  I hope that this helps the very yummy Mr. Cahill move from TV-boyfriend dujor (friends, Sex and the City) to a great movie actor.  As it is the only thing that disappointed me was that he was running around the Cities last summer, and I had no idea.If you are still reading this it goes without saying that I think you should see this movie.  Sure you know how it ends, you've probably seen the game at least once on ESPN Classic even if you are old enough to remember it in the first place.  The portrayal of our country at such a dark time in the world's history is historically great.  Apt tribute is paid to Afghanistan (even if we are repeating the USSR's mistakes now), the Ayatollah, the oil embargo, and the general distrust in government.  The Miracle on Ice was a very bright spot in a very dark time, and Miracle does a wonderful job showing just that.  To those who say, who outside the US cares?  I say hockey fans care.  Sports fans care.  This is not just a hockey movie (though it is a great one); it is a movie about hard work and perseverance. Isn't that what America really stands for?So, Bravo Disney.  I think Herby would have been pleased.  I know that I am.",0
Miracle,"I was too young to have known anything about this game when it was played in real life, but it was definitely more than a game. It concerned world politics and the cold war. The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don't know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.FINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don't miss this one.",0
Miracle,"It's hard to recreate the magic of a once-in-a-lifetime event, but Miracle comes pretty close. It succeeds in recapturing the spirit of the times, the personality of coach Herb Brooks, the tension of the game, and the exhilaration of Al Michaels' famous call as the clock went to 0:00. While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success. A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all. It's a great sports movie that suffers only in comparison to the real story. I gave it 8/10.",0
Miracle,"MIRACLE, the Disney retelling of the U.S. Hockey squad's astonishing Gold Medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980, is not a great film (a TV-movie from 1981, ""Miracle on Ice"", despite the bizarre casting of 69-year old Karl Malden as 43-year old coach Herb Brooks, is superior, although relying heavily on TV footage for game sequences), but it does offer Kurt Russell in one of the finest performances of his long career.The 53-year old Russell, a life-long veteran of both TV and film (making his debut on a ""Sugarfoot"" TV episode, at age 6), has developed a reputation over the past two decades as a very competent, if not overpowering leading man, primarily in action films (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, TOMBSTONE, BREAKDOWN) and comedies (USED CARS, CAPTAIN RON, OVERBOARD). What is often forgotten, however, is that he has remarkable 'range' as an actor, with brilliant performances in the TV-movie ""Elvis"" (1979), the underrated SWING SHIFT (1984, where he met his long-time love, Goldie Hawn), and 2003's DARK BLUE (as a crooked cop searching for redemption during the bloody aftermath of the Rodney King riots in L.A.). As age has carved his features, Russell has lost the ""beach boy"" glamor that had often 'stereotyped' him in the past, and gives his 'Herb Brooks' a sense of credibility and pain that lifts his performance to Academy Award caliber.Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. Despite success in coaching a string of national champion college hockey teams, he had never recovered from being the last player 'cut' from the 1960 Gold Medal U.S. hockey squad, and from being a member of the '64 and '68 teams that were humiliated by the Soviets. Driven by a desire to beat the nearly invincible Russian squad, he realized that a group of college 'all-stars' would never possess the 'team' skills to get the job done. Ruthlessly, refusing the assistance of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Committee, he pieced together a squad of talented skaters, 'broke' them, then remolded them to fit his vision, working them unmercifully for over six months, while spouting Vince Lombardi-like platitudes. Despite his torturous regimen, just days before the Olympics, his team would be humiliated by the Soviets, 10-3, and no one gave his squad a chance for a medal.But Brooks had faith, and a squad that was 'hungry'...While the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's 'feel' of the decade is well-done, using montages and voice-overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The unexpected U.S. victory galvanized the nation (Al Michaels' stunned reaction, ""Do you believe in Miracles?"", has become a catch phrase for both the game, and the times), and actually contributed to turning the country around.While the Academy Awards will probably ignore Kurt Russell's commanding performance (as the film was not a 'hit'), MIRACLE is still a film worth viewing, given our own troubled times. While the film may not be 'great', it's message of hope is certainly worthwhile!",0
Miracle,"Miracle is a Walt Disney movie about hockey. This sounds like Mighty Ducks, but believe me, it's not. Miracle stands on its own as a great movie. Disney has made true stories about sports in the past like Remember the Titans, and movies like that had the same Disney feel. Miracle is a movie for everyone to go see. It is a wonderful movie about a true game in history.This movie tells the story of Herb Brooks. Brooks works endlessly studying films and picking players to represent the United States in the Olympics. He doesn't just see this as a job, but he sees it as a second chance. Brooks was on the 1960 Olympic hockey team, but just before they left to compete, Brooks was cut from the team. The team went on to win, but Herb Brooks wasn't there to get the gold. Now this is his chance to win. The movie starts with Brooks getting the job and from there we see his plan. Brooks tells his players from the start how he's not going to be their friend, but he's going to be their coach. When Brooks says something he means it. Brooks changes the way the Americans play and he teaches them the way their tough opponents play. Brooks plans to beat them at their own game. It seems impossible in the beginning for Brooks to get these young guys that have never played together, and teach them a whole new way to play. It also seems impossible for the USA team to defeat the Soviet Union. The Soviets seem like an unstoppable force that can't be beaten. When you see the Soviets in action it does look impossible, but this movie shows how nothing is impossible. Miracle really doesn't go into all of the players, except Jim Craig. Craig and his father are going through a tough time because of Mrs. Craig's death. You see Jim struggle and all you want throughout the movie is for him to win the big one for his family. Besides Jim Craig, you're never really introduced to the rest of the guys. The only one that you're with throughout the movie is Herb Brooks, well portrayed by Kurt Russell. You see what it's like to assemble a winning team. You also see Brooks getting so caught up in his work that he has no time for his family. All you want is for this guy to win.This movie is more than just a sports movie. It is a movie that shows dreams can come true. You watch a team of young guys bond and become a family. You see these guys win from all of their hard work and determination. Their win at the time was a miracle and even today watching this movie you get the same great feeling that these guys did the impossible. This is a great sports movie and even if you don't like sports, it is still a great movie.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a movie that you should definitely see if you're down because it is a movie about hope. It is also about victory and when the movie is over it will have every red-blooded American cheering for the good old USA. This movie must have done something right because it had everyone get just as excited as they would have been years ago. When the USA team shoots that final goal to make the score 4 to 3 and the clock starts to wind down, you see everyone getting more and more excited. Finally when the clock runs out and you see that the USA has won, everyone is on their feet cheering. Then when the American flag is waved high in the air you hear the people in the theater cheering USA. Miracle made you feel as if you were back in time witnessing the real game. The movie lets you know what's going on at the time with clips from history and it is just amazing how a film can do this. Be sure not to miss this spectacular film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. The movie is well written, well acted, and well filmed so Miracle gets a Hat Trick.",5
Miracle,"Kurt Russell does a wonderful job of portraying Herb Brooks, an innovative hockey coach, and a hard-driving motivator of the young American team that competed at, and won, the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic hockey championship. Indeed, everyone is great, including the hockey players who learned to act to portray the famous group of college amateur players that Brooks pulled together to form a tight-knit and well-conditioned squad.Camera work and re-creation of key plays is amazing -- maybe the best hockey footage ever shot (see the DVD special features). Also touching is the collage of tragic events involving the USA in the 60's and 70's, leading up to the Olympics. By the way: I found the (voiceover) speech we hear from 1980 by Jimmy Carter (""The USA has a crisis of confidence.."") as moving as MLK's famous ""I have a dream"" speech. It sets the stage nicely for the events that follow - we all need a dream from time to time, or maybe a Miracle.And you don't feel sorry for the Russians, this the last vestige of an arrogant cold-war-produced hockey machine: seasoned veterans laying out college kids with nasty body-checks, or slashes (just in case you thought us Canucks had the patent rights to tough hockey). Good news, though: the USA was up to it, repaying hefty checks in spades.Finally, there is is some insight into Brooks hockey ideas, years ahead of their time: carefully-rehearsed breakout plays, circle patterns of player movement, and short 40-50 second shifts to keep players fresh.There is a nice up-to-dater on where the players were in 2006 when the film was made, but the NHL careers were overlooked - several of these guys went on to have stellar careers in professional hockey. The talent level was substantial.Anyway-- good job all around.",5
Miracle,"Miracle is, in my book, a great sports film. Disney is finally able to come back with a smash hit sports film. Miracle follows the true-life story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his team in there goal of winning the 1980 Olympic games in hockey. Standing against them is the seemingly invincible Russian squad who the team must overcome.The film follows the entire team from training, to the cut lists, and right to the Olympics. Instead of a dragging sap story, Disney decides to focus the movie more equally with Herb Brooks and his family and the team and there own little family they've formed between themselves. I'm really not to fond of the sport of hockey but the scenes on the ice are beautifully crafted and filmed. The drama is well-placed and you feel as if your part of the team and feeling everything they do. I really found this movie to be good. Kurt Russell is great as Coach Brooks and he is supported by some great actors as his team and some of the sons of the actual players who won the game. This is a great sports drama, no Hoosiers but very, very close.Miracle. Starring: Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkson, Noah Emmerich, and Sean McCann.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",4
Miracle,"This was a pretty nice movie overall. It had its bad points but they were more subtle. The good stuff was out in front: the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true-life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the ""miracle."" That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.The story also is about Herb Brooks, the coach of the team. Everything in here centers around him. Kurt Russell does a nice job playing him, although I don't understand the Polish accent Russell used. Why would Brooks have a Polish accent?Over the years, sports movies - as in other genres - are becoming more and more realistic. This was about as good as it gets in that regard. A number of the actors are players, meaning they know how to skate. A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. It's not fake; these guys know how to play the game and the camera-work, along with the sound, is outstanding.For a fairly long film (135 minutes) this film moves by fast and the drama is there but not super-intense since everyone knows the final result. The story is basically, as mentioned, about Brooks and the way he molded a group of kids together to play so well as a team. Many of his ideas would not have been implemented had others had a say, but Brooks proved them all wrong.The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical Liberal slant that Hollywood just has to put in our faces every chance it gets. Here, they do it by quick cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter. They have just stuck with the hockey angle, which the filmmakers here did extremely well. Still, it's a very good sports movie that even non- hockey fans should enjoy.",5
Miracle,"At first I thought.... there is way too much dialog and way too little hockey (or humor) ... but that all changed in the second half of the movie which made the first half well worth the wait. Kurt Russell plays the no-nonsense Herb Brooks, the coach of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team that won the Olympic Gold. (Do you remember where you were?)I guess what most impressed me about the film was how amazing the editing and camera work was. I think it will count as a ""first"" in a lot of categories, not the least of which was camera work. The way they spliced the actual historical footage, (courtesy of the Olympic Committee) with the new footage and the actors, was so seamless and elegant, and the result was quite compelling and original. I don't think I've ever seen such well executed editing before, not even in the Hobbit movies ;-).
The story itself was sweet and compelling. Kurt Russell was great, in that you come to a point where you really hate this bastard so much, you just want to say, ""No, You skate again you mother(bleep)er!"" I love the 70's haircuts and clothes and the accents.. the larger issues of the Cold War are not too fore fronted, but they are present enough that you see how important the win is for the US. Also, you see that his coaching really did pay off in the end: There is a point where the MC says, ""the US has never out-skated the Soviets like this before..."" and you recall the practice that Brooks makes them skate even after the rink has closed. (He was pretty brutal.) The Russian players are down-right frightening, so you get a real sense of what these kids are up against... they can hardly make eye contact they are so intimidated... but in the end, the ""eye scene"" as I call it, is enough to make even the biggest cynic, ""get veclemt"".Some people have called the film vapid nationalism (others are p***ed off because it was filmed entirely in Canada) but I think it was more about what a team of players (not any one individual or prima dona player) can do. It was also the last time a team of real amateurs actually won, before players became entertainers commanding million plus salaries, so I guess it has some important historical value.The film also has a real ""Indie"" feel. It stars all kinds of unknowns and has all kinds of low-budget effects, the scenes mostly taking place on the rink or in locker rooms. There are many moments when your heart breaks for some of the players and their families.I enjoyed it immensely and it sort of re-awakened my interest in hockey, which I'd long written off as too violent... Even the early fight scene between a player from Boston and Minnesota, which the coach encourages: ""Don't stop them,"" he says to his assistant coach, played awesomely by Noah Emmerich (remember, Jim Carey's best buddy in the Truman Show?)  is endurable when seen within the larger mission. Sadly this coach died in real life, according to the movie, before it was released... I guess he died just recently (and suddenly, though I don't know the whole story.)Anyhow I give it 8 out of 10 stars. A good and somewhat sad movie about a history that now seems too distant.",0
Miracle,"In 1980, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a former Olympics hockey player cut from the winning 1960 U.S. team, put together a ragtag band of college hockey players, taking them to the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid to face the seemingly invincible Russian hockey team, winners of four successive gold medals. Miracle tells the true story of how they worked together to defy the odds working against them. Everyone likes a good upset especially when they can cheer on the winning team. Miracle gives you that story and its a nice film to watch with your family. I don't watch hockey because I don't really like it and its just not very appealing to me. But there's things that non-hockey fans can enjoy from this film. I liked the determination from the team and the inspiration the coach gave to them. Kurt Russell does an awesome job as Herb Brooks, probably his best performance in a long time. Patricia Clarkson does a good job playing his wife and all the players on the team aren't bad either. The one actor that was bad was Noah Emmerich, he just showed little to no emotion and didn't really put in a good effort. This wouldn't had been a problem if he had a small role but he was the assistant coach. Miracle is directed by Gavin O'Connor and he does a good job. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool. The focus is on mainly on Russell and while you learn some stuff about the players it would had been nice if they had shifted some of the attention on them as well. The screenplay may be filled with clichs but the film does it right even if it feels like you have seen it before because you probably have. The film is 135 minutes long and for me it started dragging a little and getting kind of boring. The movie is also predictable so the ending game as well as the entire movie isn't really suspenseful. The focus is more on beating Russia then actually winning the medal. When they do play in the final game and win the medal, they only show them scoring the winning shot. After that Kurt Russell starts talking saying how they won the last game by coming up from behind. While we know the outcome to the whole thing it still would had been nice if they had added a few more scenes. Its also better then The Mighty Ducks but that's not a hard thing to do. Rating 7/10 a treat for hockey fans and a film that a normal movie-goer can enjoy.",3
Miracle,"Miracle is one of the better sports movies that I have seen. The movie portrays the United States team's unlikely Gold Medal victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics. It does one hell of a job at capturing one of the greatest moments in sports history.There are many elements that make the movie great. The actors really get into it and make you believe they are the players. Kurt Russell turns in an astounding performance as Team USA's coach Herb Brooks.The critical event in the movie however is the time period and events surrounding everything. The Miracle On Ice occurred during the Cold War and not long after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Morale was deteriorating at home and the country was in desperate need of a morale booster. That came in the form of a hockey game.The Soviet Union had been the dominant hockey power for years winning gold medals in 64, 68, 72, and 76. The US is a team made up of young college kids molded into an effective unit by coach Herb Brooks. The US would end up playing the Soviets as a huge underdog. It is a story of the little team that could versus the superpower. David versus Goliath basically. The events taking place made this more then a hockey game. This was a competition between 2 countries with heightened tensions. Even before the puck drops you can feel the intensity in the air.Overall you don't have to like hockey or know an ice skate from a roller skate to appreciate this movie. It is an unlikely underdog story surrounded by international turmoil. The movie is inspiring and the best fact is it really happened. Miracle is a must see.",5
Miracle,"Even if you're not a sports fan you can appreciate this movie for being historically accurate. Compared to other sports movies, this one and ""Hoosiers"" are the two best ever made.It begins with scenes from the 70's and they do a great job throughout pointing out the Iran hostage crisis, gasoline shortages and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, yet not to the point where any of those things are overdone. I wish they would've shown more of the gold medal game against Finland, but the movie was already long enough and it might have taken away from the drama of beating the Soviets. As for other things, Kurt Russell is excellent as Coach Brooks. My favorite scenes with him are the ""Great Moments"" speech and when he tells the team of the Russian style of play and how they can play with them by attacking rather than defending. And I love the fact that they got a small clip of the famous Mean Joe Greene Coke Commercial, which in fact came out at that time, the fall of 1979.The outcome is predictable, since we all know who won, but in spite of that, this movie has plenty of drama and suspense. Finally, this is also a family friendly movie--no excessive profanity or sexual scenes. Definitely a ""10"" in my book.",5
Miracle,"The film Miracle (2004) directed by Gavin O'Connor, tells the true story of Herb Brooks, the coach of the struggling US Olympic Hockey Team in his quest to beat the odds. Both the Movie Miracle and the events which it chronicled were set in the year 1980. At this time there was great upheaval in the world because the US and the USSR were embattled in a prolonged cold war, where neither nation trusted the other. The competitive nature between the two countries was seen in all aspects but especially in sports. The Soviet hockey team at this time was considered to be unbeatable previously winning the Olympics for twenty years straight. The film follows Brooks on his journey to transform a group of young and inexperienced US Hockey players into a cohesive team and overcome the best hockey team in the world.Miracle stars the accomplished actor Kurt Russell as the notorious Herb Brooks, a tough and fearless hockey coach, determined to win. Russell was able to capture the personality of Brooks so well that at times it feels as if it were really Brooks on the bench directing his team. He achieves not only the look, but the body language, facial expressions and Minnesotan accent as well. The event of the 1980 winter Olympics at Lake Placid is recreated so well throughout the movie that the natural performances of the actors only helped to enhance the feeling of really being there. The young actors picked to portray the team play their roles perfectly. Unlike other movies the majority of the cast in Miracle were not professional actors; in fact many of the actors had never acted before. The director cast actual hockey players so that the viewer can really experience the bond of a team and to ensure that the performances' of the actors would feel realistic.One of the most convincing performances in the film comes from Eddie Cahill who plays Jim Craig. Cahill is able to illustrate through his acting the immense amount of pressure he was going through as the goalie of the team. His role was pivotal to the film because it helped the viewer understand what it was like to be on both sides, from the perspective of both player and coach. The actors used to portray the team are successful in their pursuits and their acting as a collective creates a feeling of unity. The actors work well together and create a truly believable team.If you are a fan of inspirational sports films Miracle will not disappoint. It has everything you are looking for in this genre of film and more. The film is both interesting and entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Miracle was made with such passion and enthusiasm that the real players who lived it support the film proudly. The film is a fitting tribute to Brooks who died before the film was finished and is dedicated to him in the closing credits.",5
Miracle,"I stopped myself from chanting USA USA in the theater, because my wife would have left, but I still got emotional and raised my hands up when the US scored.  I still miss the Jets leaving the Peg, and still have the game reflexes when I watched the movie with a hockey crowd.  I remember watching most of the games when I was eleven.  Everyone hated the big Red machine from the Soviet Union, that killed the NHL all stars, and team USA afterward in a pre-Olympic game.  Part of the cold war fever taking place and this movie showed the importance of the game back in 1980. I was chanting USA USA while watching the game, live at home and remember Craig with the flag, all the players standing on the podium during the medal ceremony.  This must of had a huge influence on Hockey in the USA, and turned a lot of youngsters onto the game!  Being a hockey nut I remember watching the US during the 80's and they would lose in the first round at the Canada cups but with the younger players coming up they got better in every tournament, and finally made the cup final in 1992.  This event and the infusion of Canadian junior hockey coaches into their college system makes the US, the hockey power it is today.  Is is no longer just Canada and the Russians, I figure there will be many Canada, USA olympic gold medal games with maybe a movie about it one day.  Great hockey movie the advisors made the goaltending, and puck movement so real.  Russell looks and acts like a coach, from the coaching view, not the fan.  Brooks later became the coach of the Rangers, it was classy of them showing his picture at the end of the movie. 7 out of 10",4
Miracle,Rousing sports film about the 1980 U.S. Hockey team features some nicely shot game footage and a solid performance from Kurt Russell as the driven coach. Suffers from some formula moments and a clunky subplot with Russell's wife (Patricia Clarkson) but otherwise a fine piece of entertainment. GRADE: B,4
Miracle,"Kurt Russell gave an absolute towering performance as the U.S. hockey team coach in charge of getting his team to defeat an excellent Soviet team in the Olympics in this 2004 film.The picture reminded me greatly of the 1988 basketball film where Gene Hackman was also quite a stickler.Though the Russell character of Herb Brooks did ultimately have a heart, he drove his players. His making of players repeat certain items for hours on end was memorable.The picture has a back drop of events occurring in our nation from the turbulent times of the late '60s and '70s. The hockey contest between the U.S. and the USSR became one of a political nature due to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Patricia Clarkson plays Russell's wife. She is understanding and when push comes to shove, she stands by her man.",5
Miracle,"this movie is so much more than just a sports movie. it deals with the issues of the cold war and communism. it also shows how the country was helped by the seemingly impossible win against the soviets. the casting is perfect, down to the regional accents. the hockey scenes are absolutely unbelievable, and the hockey players turned actors are wonderful. Jim Craig, Jack O'Callahan, and MIke Eruzione each display a touching story that follows them through their struggles on the 1980 hockey team. Kurt Russell's acting is so fierce, that I almost couldn't tell the difference between him and the real Herb Brooks at the end. Although some scenes are absolutely heart-wrenching, the movie as a whole is absolutely inspiring. And it helps that the young hockey boys are easy on the eyes.",5
Miracle,"I'm not a big sports fanatic and yet I keep falling in love with these incredible emotionally powerful and moving sports films, specifically Disney's as of late. The deeply moving, touching and just plain nice Greatest Game Ever Played and now finally I get around to seeing 2004's Miracle. Miracle was quite simply incredible. Well acted, beautifully directed, powerful, invigorating and touching. People certainly consider it controversial calling the film historically inaccurate, American driven, and over hyped and perhaps it is but I don't think they are seeing the real story and message behind those games. This was the end of an era. The Cold war raged for nearly five decades and this was like the pinnacle of the average American's involvement with the Cold War. This was a team that was going to take on the most powerful nation in the world not in war but in sport on ice, with rules. Fairly newcomer and unknown director Gavin O'Connor does an absolutely brilliant job of recapturing the spirit and turbulence of the seventies moving towards the end of the cold war. On top of making you remember those days and the seventies from politics to sports to the average person's life he manages to bring out this incredible story of people, a team and a Coach who would do anything to get this team that medal.Kurt Russell plays tough as nails Coach Herb Brooks. Hands down Russell gives an Oscar Worthy performance. He was robbed because I am certain he belonged up there. His performance as Herb Brooks is moving and so diverse. We see every angle of him, his passion for hockey, his love for his family, and his utter raw determination to train this team to be the best in the world through all odds. Russell is as good for the team as he is downright cruel but his methods are all for good reason as we see. Any Russell fan as I am NEEDS to see this movie. He is incredible. He is by far the star and stand out performance in the film. Granted the film really is about him and Herb Brooks' story. The rest of the cast is very much supporting cast but they all do a great job. The hockey team in particular are all so important and I would love to list them all but sadly I won't. I will say though that they are all fantastic and they all have their moments. I have to mention Eddie Cahill, for a couple of reasons. First of all I am a huge CSI New York Fan which he is a regular cast member of. But more importantly he does a great job as intense goalie Jim Craig. Craig gets a bit more of a back story having his mother pass away and her wish for him to play for the Olympic team. Seeing Craig's father (Malcolm Stewart) at his final game cheering him on was moving!! Cahill's performance is moving and he is so intense and a powerful presence on screen. Patrick O'Brien Demsey, Kenneth Mitchell, Eric Peter-Kaiser, and Bobby Hanson are some of the more prominent members of the team and they are just fantastic. Much like the story of this team they are an on screen team. An ensemble cast who works together flawlessly. Noah Emmerich plays Assistant coach Craig Patrick and he is good. I found him a little low brow up against such powerful performances especially Russell but still he is a worthy addition to the cast.Miracle is a classic film, case closed. It goes into my books as one of my all time favorites. I won't ever forget Herb Brooks screaming...AGAIN!...and Craig Patrick reluctantly blowing his whistle to force the boys to do drills till they are literally sick. It captures an era, a moment in history of sports that won't ever be topped quite likely. A shining moment in US History and an important moment to many. Whatever people may say about Miracle it will give you shivers, make you smile, it's the feel good movie of the decade. I will watch this again and again and again...FANTASTIC!! 10/10",5
Miracle,"Thanks mostly to the guys that actually won the gold, but thanks as well to the actor/hockey players that made the film possible. You guys were all awesome, and it had to be hard.............Did Kurt Russel actually slap on ccm's and skate?......I need to know that! Thank you for a great movie.....to the cast, thank you.......you have no idea what it means to a guy in my generation, that was there....thank you! You guys all seem very nice........most of you you are playing somewhere. Reguardless, I wish all of you the best of luck. I'll bet you were all thinking what it might have been like to play in the olympics.....some of you may..............remember 1980.......you guys were in diapers, but I was there!......I love you all, Patrick",0
Miracle,"I can sincereley say, as a 40 year old guy, I was there! I was maybe 3 years too young to have tried for the team, and I pursued other things, like golf, after it happened.....but I wish I was 3 or 4 years older....I could have tried for that team. I recently got cut from my pick-up league team, because I turned 40 last February 14th.......they let me slide for a while..but the age limit is 40. My knees are shot, anyway........but when I watch that movie.....I cry like a child, because I remember it, and I played ice hockey for too many years. I have friends, from the NY Islanders.......my buddies from the dynasty!!...Clark Gillies, Bobby Ny, Eddy Westfall, Bill Torre......I love you all....and I love the young guys that had the balls to do it for us in 1980!",0
Drive,"One reviewer here suggested that instead of seeing Drive you should see what Drive was aspiring to be Layer Cake. Drive is nothing like Layer Cake nor even tries to be. They have nothing in common, and the comment is just absurd. It is a far far better film though. From it's title sequence written in cursive pink (which a ton of idiots just did not get for some reason) to it's retro soundtrack. It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's, 70's and 80's. If you have not seen films from this era (i do believe so many reviewers here have not) you will not entirely get this film.This is a man with no name film. Instead of horses and cowboys we get fast muscle cars and ruthless gangsters. Our hero is a man with no name. He is also a man of very few words that can break out into fits of extreme violence at any moment to protect those he cares about. We get no back story to our hero just like the Eastwood pictures, which makes the film even more effective. He is not your typical Vin Diesel blabbering idiot action hero. He is an old fashioned action hero. Too many here did not understand this, and decided this was bad acting/directing. It is far better to imagine what Gosslings character has done to arrive at this point, than to be shown in some cheesy flash back sequence. Albert Brooks (who is just fantastic as usual), Ron Pearlman, and Bryan Cranston all provide nice contrast to our quiet hero.Another reviewer here stated there was no explanation for the second car at the pawn shop. Well there was. I will not give it away here, but you will find the answer in the motel sequence. The violence has also been hated on here, but it is just part of the world he lives in. The fact that he can be just as cruel as the gangsters adds to the mystery of his character.Not one negative review is credible. Unless you were raised on Transformer and Fast and Furious pictures. Then I guess you would need more CG, louder music, and bad duologue so you could understand the film easier. Or maybe you just need more imaginary computerized cars doing spectacular things on screen to hold your attention. The fact is this is a fantastic film, filled with great performances, and some of the best chase sequences since bullet. Be smart see films that matter.",0
Drive,"'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.",0
Drive,"You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you've never seen him, speaking only when necessary, with tension and fury in his eyes. He's silent, caring, and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film, for it is truly that different. ""Drive"" is already the best of the year, because I'm POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has. This is not just a classic for its genre, but a beautiful and bold classic in general.",5
Drive,"A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I've seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both ""difficult"" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn's situation is that he makes films about ""Primal"" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla's intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a ""Vlad the Viking goes to the New World"" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly ""directed"" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn't have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film's true ""feel"".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling's half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichs provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling's quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling's film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro's Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann's hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA clich of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.",5
Drive,"After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality  humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality  is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.",0
Drive,"A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans.",0
Drive,"I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on, Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an art-house action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it.",5
Drive,"Wow!! Did I miss something here? The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot: it's barely believable and lacking in substance. While the soundtrack is very good, it also cannot save the weak dialogue which is mostly Ryan Gosling staring at people and things and not saying much at all -- we're supposed to think that's really cool. He also likes to wear that scorpion jacket even when it's been bloodied. Becoming best buddies with the neighbor's kid on the first try - really? And then willing to risk his life even after the neighbor's boyfriend comes back from prison even though she previously hit on him - really? Also, outsmarting a police helicopter in LA in the first chase scene - really?The whole movie has that whole trying really hard to be cool vibe but it's really not. Overall an extremely disappointing effort. This movie just barely makes it above the big B.",3
Drive,"I've been an IMDb member for about 5 years or so and I've rated over 650 titles. I never wrote a review before though...""Drive"" is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the ""I want my money back!"" or ""I want my two hours back!"" way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than ""Leon"", for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than ""Drive"" but have lower ratings. In my opinion it's a 6/10 movie. Full of clichs, weak plot, no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK, but that doesn't add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well, what acting? There are no characters, not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest, with a toothpick in his mouth like he's Stallone in ""Cobra"". A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey, he is a mechanic, part time stunt driver, part time get-away driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what's with all that violence? Broken skulls, throats cut, blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don't fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 year-old who managed to get tickets. And don't get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway, there are so many things that I didn't like in this movie that they wouldn't fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean, 8.7? Lets have some sense. That's how ""Matrix"", ""The usual suspects"" or ""Forrest Gump"" are rated... ""Drive"" is just a ""B"" movie and doesn't deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless, the world turns upside down.EDIT: OK, I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It's just a highly overrated movie.",3
Drive,"Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being, and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10",5
Drive,"Welcome to the first edition of Movie Math. Beware, I spoil the entire movie in this review. My sincerest apologies. First, I do not like to applaud mediocrity, even if it is well done mediocrity. I understand the underlying point of the movie, but it was really buried and I shouldn't be able to get to that point so quickly. The audience prefers to be led, not slapped into submission. It just stings less after you realize you paid $12 to be treated like an idiot. Second, I did love the neon pink script, the members only jacket and the 80's pop (which, alone, is awesome but seemed like a loud, annoying filler for scenes that had absolutely nothing going on). Combined, they seemed like an afterthought.The movie consists of about 30 minutes of good solid plot line stuffed with about 1.5 hours worth of pointless fluff (ex. the river scene, all the staring, the shots of watching TV, the random garage & test driving scenes) all meant to build character and inspire (or something). This failed completely because I actually connected more with Albert Brooks' & Bryan Cranston's characters. Both of whom had less airtime than the main characters.And plot line- wait, there isn't A plot line, there are several, terribly integrated plot lines. Think: The Notebook + Grindhouse + Steve Mcqueen + Tarantino. The narration was so clich it made me wince. Never, EVER, should narration take the place of integral character development.The love plot is absurd. She doesn't know Gosling, he's super creepy, says nothing and somehow she gets a warm/cozy vibe so she invites him over to hang out with her kid. And I thought the romance in Twilight was bad (-1 star simply because I was forced to write Twilight). The violence was eh. I've seen gory horror flicks integrate gratuitous violence into the story line better, and in a less in-your-face manner, so that was unimpressive and unimaginative(-1). Especially because, unless you're sadistic, no one actually enjoys watching someone get stabbed in the eye. As for the dialog, there isn't any, and the cars have fewer appearances than sentences. So this leads me to believe the title is meant to have more than one connotation. Warning: here is where I get all ""artsy"". The title, Drive, can be interpreted in two different ways: one being the more literal sense: someone that drives a car; the second alluding perseverance. If it is the second, then the Refn/Amini duo are sorely lacking all around and Mulligan desperately wants her kid to die quietly at the hands of an insane mechanic. There's some perseverance for you.That being said, I did not enjoy this movie. I do not require the Michael Bay effect to be entertained but please, do not treat me like a Teen wolf/Twilight moviegoer (-1 AGAIN). Long pauses do not develop character, especially when a blank affect is meant to be a representation of stoicism/wide-eyes and a mom-haircut represent vulnerability(-1 for being a giant stereotype). Even if those blank stares are backed up by a wicked soundtrack (hell yes, Chris Martinez, high five! +1)and excellent cinematography (it's already been done before but whatever: +1). However, I was constantly reminded of other movies while watching(Collateral, anyone? -1) and I was left feeling like someone (Gosling and Refn/Aminihad) watched far too many Steve Mcqueen movies. And then they attempted, quite literally, to copy the dynamics. Unfortunately, the entire team (and some of the audience)failed to realize that Mr. Mcqueen's movies were written FOR him and Mr. Gosling has not quite reached that level. So -1 for not being original. I was not impressed by Mr. Gosling's acting (What acting? It's so easy to stand around and chew a toothpick: -1) and I honestly do not understand all the hype regarding Ms. Mulligan. I've seen almost all her movies and she plays the doe-eyed victim with a giant heart in every. single. one.So -1 for typecasting. This also includes Christina Hendricks, by the way. She looked SO uncomfortable. Well, maybe that was the point, or maybe it was because her pants were too tight and she was robbing a pawn shop wearing 5"" heels. I should -1 for it being unrealistic, but this movie would then have a negative rating.Gosling and Mulligan attempt the profound ""say something by not saying anything at all"" (-1 for bad directing) but Mulligan appears dimwitted and Gosling goes from mimicking George Washington on the side of Mt. Rushmore to suddenly being a skilled fighter. I did not see that coming. Maybe that was yet another point?The stunt driver should be commended, though, he/she had some pretty tricks done with effortless flair (+ 1 for talent). So I tip my hat to you, sir/ma'am. Mustangs are not easy to do donuts in.I was bored an hour into the movie (-.5) and was squirming at the pretentiousness of the director by the second hour (-.5). That by itself says quite a bit seeing as I am an avid moviegoer and watch just about anything. May I reiterate that being reminded of others' work does not dredge feelings of nostalgia, it makes me want my $12 back. So, unless I didn't do my math correctly, I gave this movie a 3/10.",0
Drive,"At the Theater- ""Drive"" -- This is not an Action film, this is not a ""Car"" movie- It's a character-driven, slow-burn thriller of the first order that features elements of some of the finer works from Directorial royalty like Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, William Friedkin, Quentin Tarantino, Walter Hill and the late Sam Peckinpah.The film is an electric mixture of beautiful, lingering cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, lean dialogue and short bursts of graphic, bloody violence. It's tense and involving- almost impossible not to get immersed in. Nicolas Winding Refn is a Director to definitely keep a tab on.Ryan Gosling is the embodiment of some kind of cold fire at the heart of the matter- his ""Driver"" character is a well-intentioned but unstoppable force that will surely end up as a cult favorite for decades to come. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Oscar Issac round out an excellent cast that's pretty much in support but extremely well-utilized.Those wanting to check out a quick and disposable, mindlessly fun popcorn flick need to steer clear- this isn't what you're looking for. This is deadly-serious film-making that's damned-near perfect.It's my favorite film of the year- Hell, it's one of my all-time top faves.9.5 outta 10",5
Drive,"When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.",5
Drive,"Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to protecting what is important to you. There are a few moments where he doesn't just cross that line but obliterates it completely.Beautifully crafted pounding action thriller with twisted humor and seriously hard core violence. Compelling tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional world of the protagonists. Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world. View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography. Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun intended). I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging. Drive leaves them all in the Dust. This filmed was viewed on the Big Screen at the LAFILMFEST screening June 17th 2011",5
Drive,"I really tried to like this movie but honestly it was pretty strange. First of all there's no real story. I feel no connection to any of the characters or the acting. Gosling is this weird arrogant silent guy that we never learn much about. All the other characters are quite clich. The coincidence is also pretty strange that Gosling happened to live in the same floor as the guy he wants to help with money problems is actually in dirty business with the guy sponsoring Gosling. Plus the movie is called ""drive."" I expected to see little more stunts than just unrealistic and unnecessary handbrake spinning in only one scene. The filming and setting were the only good things about this movie. Not even the music was catchy. I feel like I've been have a strange plot less and lifeless dream while watching this movie. NO substance at all and strange acting i will rate this movie maximum a 6.8. I don't understand what the hype is and why people are going crazy about it. It really is something just to pass time let alone a masterpiece. As if everything mentioned wasn't bad enough the violence is just downright ridiculous and again unnecessary. Who is one second kiss a girl romantically and the next second bashing someones skull open. I don't even know what else to say, this is a movie i will remember for being slow and strange.",0
Drive,"It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Seemingly a loner, the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract, the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a well-worn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller, yet the massively talented director, who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive, crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn, previously known for the fantastic Bronson, and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy, is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick, but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson, the influence was a little more obvious, with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however, the traces are a little more subtle, visible in the impeccable technical touches, and the use of dissolves, pensive long takes, and slow zooms, a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film, filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast, and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, the ever dependable Ron Perlman, and particularly Brooks, who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance, which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season. Mulligan shows characteristic heart in a largely overlooked role, yet the film unquestionably belongs to Gosling. Often heralded as one of the finest actors of his generation, in Drive Gosling delivers his best work yet as the driver; a quiet role that is all the more effective due to the subtlety of the performance. He displays an ability to ratchet up the tension using just the slightest widening of his eyes and tensing of his jawline, and when the character is pushed to act more forcefully, Gosling transitions from almost silent observer to brutal aggressor so swiftly that it leaves one breathless. It's work that he makes look easy, yet it's the most focused performance seen in an action film in quite some time.There's something undeniably retro about Drive, with its neon opening titles and 80s infused soundtrack, but the film seems remarkably fresh. Smart action filmmaking is so hard to come by these days, so Drive delivers refreshing variety, beginning the time of year when the so-called prestige pictures are released with a bang.tinribs27.wordpress.com",5
Drive,"Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as an escape car artist for local thugs. He gets involved in the life of his next door neighbor, her kid and the husband who owes money to the mafia boss Gosling's character happens to works for.The film plays out terribly as the murky and meager plot is all over the place and the pacing of the film so off, it just beggars belief. The many scenes just showing Gosling's blood stained clothes are so slow and stretched that you can see the changing of seasons in the background. And every time our hero starts to talk there's a standard 6 seconds delay before he actually starts to mutter his script lines. Pause in a conversation can add drama to the moment, but I shouldn't have to be tearing the hair from my cranium while watching it. Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers; excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked, then strip away the interesting characters, the music, the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.I'm seriously left dumbfounded as to what prompts people to vote on this miserable excuse for entertainment with more than 6 stars. Perhaps it is the overall quality of films nowadays which seems to be in a hasty decline, rendering people clueless as to what rating to give to a film. But I can safely say that this project is as lifeless as it is artless and I would recommend the 1999 movie Ghost Dog in stead. A movie that shares many parallels with 'Drive' but which is made with far more authenticity, humor and overall class. Not to mention it having an actual silver lining and point to it.30/100",1
Drive,"This is an awful movie. Perhaps all the more so because there were the ever-so-slight hints that it might have been good.Watch the first half-hour. Gosling's (unnamed) character, when spoken to, takes ridiculously long pauses--upwards of 10 seconds--to respond.>>>Spoilers ahead The story is, um, flimsy. Porn-movie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well (sure, it looked really cool when that other car showed up, but... wwwhy was it there, exactly?), and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it: Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that's really been masterminded by... the guy who's bankrolling his race car? Huh? (and, no, the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this).As much as I love Ryan Gosling, he's just plain bad here. Maybe not ""just plain"" bad; spectacularly, pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas"" that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is okay, but her character is pretty one-dimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I'm sorry, I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan's husband appears, there's actually a little tension for a bit, and I began to hope for some substance (especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does). Sadly, ""Standard"" is killed off fairly quickly.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what's there is clichd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I've loved since ""Lost in America"". It breaks my heart, because he's actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando, I kid you not. Thoughtful, emotional, utterly believable, but since he's the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for, he's not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action, at least. And there really isn't much. For a movie about a driver, there honestly isn't that much driving. The movie opens with a not-bad robbery getaway, but there's only one more serious chase later on, and even IT isn't especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH ""Bullitt""? And, speaking of car action, there's one scene where Gosling's character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet, afterwards, we see the front end of his car, seemingly undamaged. Are mid-70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in ""Drive"". There are some genuinely original scenes of violence (and, to be fair, well-executed). Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared, well, this might have been a different movie.This is one of those ""emperor's-new-clothes"" things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while. Don't fall for it.",2
Drive,"First the good: Drive is cast with excellent actors. Now for the bad. Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.Every plot element of Drive was so unrealistic that I found it impossible to suspend belief. The characters are equally unbelievable. Less than an hour into the picture I knew how it would end. The only question was whether Gosling's character would survive, but by that point I didn't care. All the characters were too stupid to live. Violence has its place in film, but it is not a substitute for characters, a plot, and a story even when the stupid are getting their just deserts.Nothing in this picture hasn't been well done in other movies. Drive is derivative of Layer Cake, for example. If you want to see what Drive was trying to be, rent Layer Cake.",2
Drive,"In Los Angeles, a mysterious driver (Ryan Gosling) is a man of few words that works as a garage mechanic for his only friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston); stuntman in Hollywood films; and driver of getaway car in heists. One day, he helps his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in prison, and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and her falls in love with her. However, a few days later her husband Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and they meet each other in the building. Standard is pressed by the criminal Cook (James Biberi) to rob a pawn shop to pay for the protection he had in prison, and the driver decides to help him driving the getaway car. However, the heist does not work as planned, Standard is murdered and the driver discovers that they have been double-crossed by Cook. Further, the money belongs to the Mafia and now he has to protect Irene and Benicio from the mobsters. ""Drive"" is a good thriller with the lead character without a name, recalling the style of Clint Eastwood in ""High Plains Drifter"" in the role of ""The Stranger""  a man that speaks a few words only, violent when necessary that protects innocent and beloved people. The film is weirdly attractive with potential of cult movie.The stylish cinematography discloses in an adequate pace the big picture and develops characters very well. The conclusion has an open end, a characteristic that has been forgotten by Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Drive""",4
Drive,"I want my two hours back. I am convinced critics will only give a positive review if a movie is depressing and nihilistic. Don't believe the hype that this is some cinematic artistic achievement, when over 30 minutes of a two hour run time is filled with dead silence or overly long awkward pauses in dialogue , it's not ""hip and artistic"" it's just boring, nor is it ""stylish and clever"" when our main protagonist , who clearly has the upper hand at the end, defies common sense by putting himself needlessly in danger and not taking necessary precautions. I also don't find the retro 80s styling and soundtrack of a movie set in modern times to be ""artistic brilliance"" either, it's just distracting and awkward. Even our heroes' intentions seem to defy common sense,...risk your life for a girl you didn't even screw,a kid that's not yours, and her ex-con husband who doesn't even like you, that's not heroic, that's idiotic. If you want to be duped by critics who would have you believe this is ""stylish and clever neo noir"" go ahead and waste your time and money, but trust me ,once you dissect this movie for what it really is, it becomes a pointless exercise in nihilism whose plot points defy logic, common sense, and motivation, all glossed over by an over-stylized retro-80s feel and boring silence and self contemplation. Were there some good action sequences?, yes, but if you add them all up they take up about ten minutes of the run time. This one is a DVD rental at best, and by the way, if you saw this directors other film, ""Valhalla Rising"", even though the subject matter may seem completely different the theme and ending are basically exactly the same.",0
Drive,"I am a movie geek and I have been my whole life. This movie represents what I love in movies. Well crafted story, great writing and great direction. I rented this movie yesterday at Redbox and found it to be so well crafted that I watched it again (I don't usually do that.I grew up in Los Angeles and when I loved about this movie is that it gives you a real sense of the city and it's dirty underbelly that is usually missed in more common films.Ryan Gosling is so good in this movie because he isn't the prototypical bad ass that you usually would see in a movie like this and that is what I loved about it. Here is a character who is equally quiet but nice guy who obviously has a lot of history but nothing is mentioned or anything acknowledged up front.The tone is fantastic and I love that the director avoided the classic clichs that are so rampant in movies like this by giving us what is essentially a ""B"" movie and fills it with great actors and allows them to do what they do best. WOW!Albert Brooks is the Oscar snub of the year by far and I don't know how. Here is a guy who is always good at what he does and is a brilliant comedian but here he is a former small time movie producer who has deep roots in the criminal underworld and is so convincing that you have a hard time believing that this is the same guy from Lost in America or Nemo's dad. Nuance is the best tool in the performance and I can tell you that this is an understated performance that is so layered you just can't help but feel for the guy even though he is a brutal killer. He wants to be a nice guy but his actions and his business don't allow him to be.No movie was as cool and more riveting from start to finish than this one. It is my favorite movie of 2011, case closed.",5
Drive,"I'm not going to lie, before I saw this movie I thought Ryan Gosling was just another chick flick heart throb but damn my perception of him is blown.A movie so embedded with the style of classic film-noir and stylish new genre of art-house action. something that's rare in movies, though the plot is so plain, its what makes the movie fantastic, its not complex its not twist filled. May come off a little slow, but it catches you off guard, and that's what makes film great.Poetic yet violent, malnourished yet gruesome. Its a tribute to all those 80s action films with that retro feeling and cool vibe, a tale of a forbidden love and mafia heist. A protagonist which everyone can relate to, a man driven by nothing, a loner on a road with nothing and no one on it, though when something special comes along, his whole world changes.",5
Drive,"Last year one of the big films that I think was a surprise hit was called Drive. I was always curious to see this movie, but unfortunately missed it. From what I had heard it was a must see so I rented it and absolutely fell in love with it. Reminding me a bit of the old action movies from the 70's and 80's with those great old cars that could take one heck of a beating with the anti-hero who wins your heart over and then we get a million sequels trying to out bank the previous film. Anyways, Drive offers something different, a new cult classic for a generation that is a bit ADD, this gives you something exciting or great to watch each second. I can't tell you what an amazing opening chase scene they choreographed, not to mention some very exciting action scenes. Ryan Gosling continues to be a star on the high rise proving his leading man qualities and to be an action star, he just steals the show as Driver.Driver lives in a low-rent apartment building and works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. The Driver works anonymously, never for the same people twice, and allows them only five minutes to do their business. He meets his neighbor Irene in the apartment building elevator and later helps her and her young son when Irene has car trouble at a local market. Shannon owns the garage the Driver works at and arranges his other jobs. Shannon persuades the mobster Bernie Rose to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race after seeing the Driver's skill. Bernie's business partner is Nino, a Jewish mobster. But when Driver has been set up he realizes that not only does he have to protect himself but those he cares about most.The car chase scenes are so well put together, I haven't been this excited since Death Proof. I also loved how Driver's face in the first scene just stayed emotionless, he knows he's good and that no matter what how to out run the cops. He's a man with a mission who doesn't have anyone in his life, but when a woman and her son come into his, he will fight for them because they're worth it. He has a man, who's his boss, who is almost like his father figure and their relationship is not only believable but relatable for anyone. Bryan Cranston has come quite a way since Malcolm in the Middle, he does a great job and conveys such a likability to what could have been a bland and boring character. The bloodshed in the movie is absolutely insane, like I said, this reminds you a bit of a 70's action drive in movie. There's buckets of blood and tons of violence. I also loved having Ron Pearlman as this typical mobster who's terrifying to cross paths with but you can't forget that he's Jewish. What a great addition to the character. I think Drive was one of the better movies that came out of 2011, it has everything that you could want in an action movie. Action, romance, great soundtrack, cool cars and awesome chase scenes. Let's put it this way, I rented it, watched it, the next day I bought it, it was totally worth it.9/10",5
Drive,"Seriously people, don't believe the ridiculous hype about this movie, it is without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. My wife and I are huge movie fans and watch on average 5 new films a week, 10 minutes into this film we are both looking at each other with a 'is this movie for real' look on our faces, and by the end we realised we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives we would never get back again.Rylan Gosling is a total joke from start to finish, his total lack of any script is just the start, in fact by the end of the film (and yes we did make it to the end, somehow) I was glad he still wasn't saying much, and the little that did come from it was just clichd nonsense. This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all, especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with, wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back, and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot, what there was of it, is so old and tired and so overdone, the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them, probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan, who is a real favourite of ours, was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character - the single mum at home. And the clichs just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme, graphic and vicious, which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it, unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly again, now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate - characters that aren't black and white, minimal dialogue to add to the tension, and stunning camera-work to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead, Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.",1
Rambo,"First Blood (1982) is a classic action movie that started all action genre one man army types action movies. It is my personal favorite movie of all time. I am a huge Rambo fan and I love John Rambo character. I love First Blood, Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo to death. I love them so much it is my favorite film series. I love First Blood to death this is my personal favorite action film. It is in my top 5 Stallone's favorite action films part 4 and 5 is Cliffhanger and Demolition Man. It is my personal favorite action film in the Rambo series. I love Rambo: First Blood Part II to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in the action genre. First Blood is my personal favorite action film of all time it is right up there with Part II. It is my number 3 favorite action in the Rambo series but I still love First Blood to death.This is my comic book hero this is my childhood movie the movie I grew up with it. This is the best movie ever my all time favorite action movie. It is the best of the best of all time. Sylvester Stallone co-write the script and started and the men can act, he is an action hero on screen in my opinion his best film. Yours is Rocky mine is Rambo action hero. I love Rambo's Survival Knife he rally's on his knife. ""I could have killed 'em all, I could've killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Don't push it! Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go. Let it go! ""First Blood is a realistic film portrayed about John Rambo a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran who saw hell in the Vietnam War and he is hunted by the past. Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.. ""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects. It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real. He feels that society is against him and he is angry. The movie has ton's of action, the motorcycle chases. Rambo climbs the wall of mountain and is been pursued by a helicopter and the police officer becomes the killer and try's to shoot Rambo with a riffle. Rambo jumps and hangs him self on the tree. That jump was for real and Sylvester Stallone really performed it. Rambo uses his martial arts to defend him self against abusive corrupt cops to escape. I love how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations. The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill, yet, he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose. John Rambo uses M60 machine gun and shoot up various stores in town including police station destroys the gun store and gas station. 
 
Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna both acted opposite Sylvester Stallone and they both acted well. Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle was excellent bad guy he performs his character well. Richard Crenna is Colonel Sam Trautman who trained and command Rambo in Vietnam for 3 years he is excellent as father figure to Rambo. ""First Blood"" is the best of the Rambo series mine personal favorite action film . The movie has beautiful music score from Jerry Goldsmith 10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval My personal favorite action movie of all time.",5
Rambo,"The ultimate action film and the ultimate psychological thriller! 'First Blood' was among others like 'Die Hard' as being one of the first action films I saw when I was younger, I even owned it on VHS. This film has Sly showing off his acting ability (which is saying something for an actor with such little capability of ""acting"") as the iconic John Rambo in the film that sparked off the eponymous film franchise, whilst the sequels were heavily classified as flops, 'First Blood' is a daring and thrilling survival adventure that follows a Vietnam Vet and the post-war trauma he suffers from. A dark yet sensitive film that follows one of the great action stars as he fights to survive, a mesmerising action masterpiece.",0
Rambo,"First Blood is simply one of the best films ever made. I think it transcends the action film genre and has stood the test of time. Stallone was immensely popular back in the 80's and if it is true that he hated the first cut of the film, then one can only say that he is lucky that he didn't get his wish to scrap the entire thing.John Rambo is first introduced to us as he is walking into a small town to look for a friend of his that he served in Vietnam with. Upon discovering that he contracted cancer coming back from the war, Rambo wanders aimlessly into town. He is greeted by a small town overzealous sheriff named Will Teasle, played wonderfully by Brian Denehy. He at first tells Rambo that he will help him out and give him a ride. When Rambo asks if he can find a good place to eat, Teasle directs him to a diner about 10 miles up the highway. Rambo asks if there is a law against him eating in the town, Teasle, says yea, me. This sets up the premise as Rambo begins walking back into town. Arrested for vagrancy, Rambo is taken to the local jail and we meet some of the local redneck officers, notably, a young David Caruso, who seems to be the only one who empathizes with Rambo. Finally, he escapes the jail and takes the entire small town sheriff department and the military on a hunt into the local ""jungle."" First Blood has strength of character. It has frenetic action scenes and every actor in the film is at the top of their game. Samuel Trautman, Rambo's mentor and former Colonel in the war, is played by Richard Crenna as a no nonsense but empathetic man. He knows Rambo has pushed back a little too hard but he understands where his plight comes from. He wants to avoid more bloodshed but at the same time he doesn't completely agree with how Rambo has been treated. He is obviously a law abiding citizen, but he knows that not all the laws were upheld when dealing with Rambo.Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell's vision is still present, this is more of Stallone's creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.First Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.10/10",5
Rambo,"Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.See this movie in widescreen to appreciate how cool it really is.",5
Rambo,"Surprise, a ""Rambo"" movie that tries to say something profound about the plight of its main character and his mental state.  For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet.   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 & 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news.  ""First Blood"" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.   That's not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more ""Cop Land"" than ""Cobra""
   Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.  Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of ""Platoon"" or ""The Deer Hunter"".  It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them.",5
Rambo,"The character of John Rambo became more popular in films such as ""Rambo:First Blood,Part II"" and ""Rambo III"".The character were treated like a comic book hero spawning action figures and a short lived animated series which lasted only a short while.There are not that many people who has heard of the Rambo character.He's well known through out,but today's generation would have been lucky to catch him on VHS or DVD.Back in 1982 when the character of John Rambo was introduced to movie screens,filmgoers were dealing with a character that was not displayed as an action icon,but a man who had a lot of demons within him.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that John Rambo is not portrayed as an action hero.He is portrayed more as a man.A man who is haunted by memories of the Vietnam War.Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.Violence in films are the main aspects in film today.Or at least one of.It's fun to watch a violent film,but the violence in this film was not filmed to thrill the audience,but to make us understand what John Rambo is going through.I have these memories of first watching this film twenty years ago when I was twelve.""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects.It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real.I like ""First Blood"" because I understand the character.He feels that society is against him and he is angry.A lot of films there is only one villain where as in this one society is the villain.That is according to Rambo.Actually,there is one villain named Sheriff Teasle played by Brian Dennehy.He and Rambo seemed to clash against each other and Ted Kotcheff let's us experience these two men go at it.I liked how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are in hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill,yet,he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose.The killing of Galt was accidental and was deserving according to my eyes.This film is the best in the Rambo series because I understand the character and I understand why he is acting violent.""First Blood"" doesn't bring us John Rambo,the action hero but John Rambo,a regular man with a lot of demons he must face.""First Blood"" is the best of the Rambo series.",5
Rambo,"I totally agree with the comments of a previous reviewer who said that Sylvester Stallone is greatly underestimated as an actor. I wouldn't go as far as calling him the best actor that Hollywood has ever had, but he IS so much better than a lot of people say that he is. In my opinion Stallone shouldn't make comedies, but when it comes to action movies (Rambo, Rocky, Cobra, etc.) he's definitely one of the best! Rambo was a sensational movie in the 80's, but every time that I see it nowadays I'm amazed by the fact that it is actually a very good, original story. Brian Dennehy really shows his acting skills as well, leaving the audience confused whether to have sympathy for the character that he plays or to hate the character. First Blood is a movie filled with action. Like all the action movies from the 1980's ""First Blood"" also tends to become slightly over the top in the end. Still I gave it a 10/10 for the simple fact that I wanted to compensate for the people who ""underrate"" this movie. Normally I would give this movie an ""8"". If it had not been for the action scenes that are over the top this movie could even have scored a bit higher!",5
Rambo,"The adaptation of this novel to the big screen is a great accomplishment. The film is not only the beginning of one of the greatest action trilogies of all-time, but it charts the developments of its characters, something rarely done by an action movie.  ""First Blood"" is a moving story about the realities of post-Vietnam America and is very underrated as a film.",4
Rambo,"This movie was a classic.  A great action movie and a movie that really showed you what vietnam soldiers went through when they came back from the war.  Stallone plays John Rambo perfectly and he is physically excellent for the role as well.  He proves at the end alone that he can act and show emotion with the best of them.  The first time i saw this i was very emotional at the end because Stallone really gives you a taste of what the soldiers had to go through when they got home.  The action is classic, The acting is classic...RAMBO is Classic. 10/10.",5
Rambo,"this is certainly not the greatest film ever made.  in fact, it's plot is predictable and formulaic, and every character is two-dimensional.having said that, this is a film that is often dismissed as a macho action flick with no redeeming feature.  these are opinions i would defy.while the only imagination put into the film seems to be the various ways in which John Rambo can kill people, the basic theme is nevertheless a pretty strong one.  this is not meant to be a Fellini-esque commentary on life, the universe, and everything.the three most important characters in the film are all played by pros. you have Stallone's John Rambo, Dennehy's Sheriff Teasle, and Richard Crenna's Colonal Trautman.Brian Dennehy hasn't missed a beat in his entire career; he's been a superb character actor since i've been watching movies, and - like Michael Caine - he always puts everything into each performance.  his Sheriff Teasle is menacing, bigoted, and protective.  he comes across like a man who's marked his territory and won't permit intrusions.  i won't say he's brilliant, but he is absolutely believable as a small-town sheriff faced with a situation so far out of his own experience that he cannot figure out why he can't solve the problem.Crenna is a patriarchial character, such as he often seems to play.  he gives the Spec Ops Colonal Trautman enough soul to make him seem human, and enough blood and guts to make him seem like a veteran soldier.
of course, the centrepiece to the film is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone always suffers from the perception engendered by his appearance.  he is a somewhat short fellow with a body of bulging unpronoucable muscles, and a sad bassett-hound face that looks like it was designed by someone out of ""Oliver Twist.""but the man can flat-out act.  he gives John Rambo depth and reality.  he comes across as far too fit and far too silent because Rambo is far too fit and far too silent.  like his character in ""Copland,"" Stallone is playing a guy who pretty much wants to be left alone and is caught up by a bunch of people around him who are overly enthused by their own status.
while i can understand the dismissal of this film as just a patriotic action sop, i cannot also accept that Stallone does not give a good performance. the man has been characatured; he's an easy target.  he's a really built short-guy.  but Stallone's intelligence and creativity drove his first film, ""Rocky,"" and neither quality has deserted him since.  like Michael Caine, he does seem to take any old lame role offered to him.  but he always gets paid, and he always puts everything into his performances.
i'll never campaign for this film to be considered a ""great"" film, but i think i'll always defend it's star as a guy who works too hard too often to get the such little credit.i guess the best way i can put it is, i watched ""First Blood,"" and i believed him.  i believed Stallone.last time i checked, that is what an actor is supposed to do.",0
Rambo,"This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels.  It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it.  There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well.  Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to.  War.  Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue.  To potentially misquote Rambo :""I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you.  In town you're the law, out here it's me.  Let it go...""",0
Rambo,"My father served in the Vietnam war at the age of 21, much like John Rambo would have had he been real. In real life, my father endured a hell hole, a place he to this day, will rarely speak of without tears in his eyes, stories have been told to me about watching his friends die over there, of seeing atrocities done by both sides, a horrible horrific situation that no man woman or child should ever have seen.He spoke to me once, of returning to Australia, to a country he loved, called home. He spoke to me of feeling proud, in his uniform, having completed his tour, of stepping off the plane.And then he told me of the ridicule and scorn he received from the general public upon his return. A return where he was called a baby killer, despite never having actually killed anyone himself surprisingly, where it was simply assumed he was the one at fault, that the public would scorn him, forget he was human, treat him like a social outcast. Treat him, like an animal.Which is part of the reason he and I bonded so well over this movie when we first watched it. Sure, it's an agrandised tale of a badly treated Vet, a man forgotten by his government, much like my own father.When we see Stallone performing as Rambo in this movie, he's not fantastical, he's not superman, he's a man who's been wronged, who fights back the only way he knows how.When you see this movie, understand that this is, despite the fantastical elements in this film, a very accurate portrayal of how our veterans are treated. They're forgotten, they're given over to an ill equipped health system, be they in Australia or America, they're treated like outcasts.The beautiful thing about First Blood, when you watch it, is it's so easy to identify with Rambo, so easy to see he's just a good man, having a bad time, who reacts in possibly the worst way to whats happening to him... but that worst way, is the only appropriate way. The torture he endures under a biased prejudiced sheriff, the lack of respect for serving his country, the health system that should've picked up on his quite obvious PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), none of it was there for him.When it hits the fan, and Rambo goes on his escape, ask yourself, is he really hunting them? If they had've let him go, wouldn't it have been better for them? Didn't he just want to be left alone after all? The one message this movie, less than subtly puts across, is something we all need to learn. Whether its WW1 or 2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm 1 or 2, you're not expected to agree with the war, you're not expected to support the war. But for gods sake support your troops. Next time your national day rolls around, like in Australia for Anzac Day, take the time to show a veteran, no matter if they're 25 or 95, show them they're appreciated, let them know they made a great sacrifice, that you respect what they did.Rambo succeeds on this level, especially Stallones final speech to Richard Crenna, which absolutely tears you apart, realising this man was plucked from obscurity, trained to be a god amongst normal men, then, when the machine of war was done with him, tossed out like a little spring from the machine, useless, unneeded and no longer wanted... where was he to go? What was he to do? It's a realistic situation that many, many veterans go through, google War Veteran Suicide rate sometime, it's an eye opening somewhat depressing look at the reality of the situation regarding our beloved Vets and the torturous return to mundane civilian life they have to go through...Don't respect the war, don't necessarily respect your government. But never, ever, disrespect the men and women who fight for your right to freedom. When you disrespect our soldiers, you disrespect everything our nations stand for. And that, is criminal.",5
Rambo,"Sure,""First Blood"" is known by people who have not seen it as a ""bang,bang,shoot 'em up"" action film. Yet,don't let what others think of it trick you. As said by another reviewer,""First Blood"" is a classic.Based off of the 1972 novel by David Morell,""First Blood"" is about a former green beret of the Vietnam War,John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone). Despite the fact that John Rambo gave a strong service to America during the years that he fought in Vietnam,lately,Rambo finds his life falling apart. This is something that has personally torn John Rambo apart.And then,one day,things take a turn for the worse. This is when John Rambo is arrested by a sheriff in a small Alaska town(Hope),Will Teasle(Brian Dennehey)for vagrancy. Shortly thereafter,before John Rambo knows it,his patience and mental state are being put to a test. The result? John Rambo escaping from the police and launching a one-man war against them and the national guard. The only person who can help everyone get through it all? Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna),a close friend of John Rambo who served with Rambo in Vietnam.Let's talk about ""First Blood"" on the whole. Similar to 1988's ""Die Hard"" and 1993's ""The Fugitive"",""First Blood"" is one of the most well-written and adapted films (despite the several differences between the film and the novel). Not only is the action in ""First Blood"" perfect for any action film,it is quite suspenseful. It is not in the script just for the sake of being there. It is in the script because it needs to be there. The action in ""First Blood"" works well into the script,and is only to be found where it belongs.There is a lot of good drama and chemistry in ""First Blood"",as well. On top of everything that John Rambo has gone through in his life being richly executed drama that fits in well with the action in ""First Blood"",the scenes with the action are not just action scenes. They are scenes that contain action,drama,and chemistry. This is due to viewers of ""First Blood"" being able to watch John Rambo fight the Police and the National Guard with not only his weapons,but at the same time,his mind. The acting is in top shape,also. All of the actors in ""First Blood"" succeed in understanding their characters and bringing their characters to life with their performances. Especially Sylvester Stallone. Will Stallone ever have the presence and respect in Hollywood that actors like Paul Newman,Al Pacino,and Robert De Niro,plus several others,have earned and achieved? Surely and probably,no. But,in his performance as John Rambo,Stallone executes the drama that his performance requires. At the same time,Stallone does not fail to let the action in ""First Blood"" to be entertaining. He gives it the kind of action you would expect to see in any film that is reminiscent of ""First Blood"" (""Lethal Weapon"",""Die Hard"",etc.). All of this is what helps ""First Blood"" fully come together,and make it the great film that it is.Overall,a must see-film for fans of not only action films,but for fans of crime drama films,as well.10/10",5
Rambo,"A lot of people know the Rambo series as a ridiculous 80's action series. But what a lot of people tend to forget is that the first movie in this series was not a ridiculous action movie. It's a serious, dark, thriller that has a very somber tone and a sympathetic lead character. Almost everything that Rambo is known for nowadays is completely absent in this movie. From the multitude of explosions to the high body count to the unrealistic action to the ridiculous story line is completely absent. There are only 2 or 3 explosions (not to mention they are realistically done) and only one person dies throughout the whole picture. and the action, while there isn't a lot, it's realistic. Even the story line you believe can actually happen. It's for these reasons that make this my favorite Rambo movie. And not to mention the fantastic and heart breaking performance given by Stallone. Why the Academy didn't nominate him for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. If you didn't like the other Rambo movies because of their ridiculousness and haven't seen this film, I highly recommend seeing it. It's one of my favorite post-war movies if not one of my favorite movies of all time.Final rating: 9/10",5
Rambo,"How people can call this the worst one of the series or just a bad movie in general is beyond me. The action is actually believable and not something out of a video game. And the storyline is good and paints a good picture of life in America after the Vietnam war. Following the tale of the best of the best it is certainly not the best but very good. Better yet is the laughs that come from watching the bad cops get theirs. The only I have to complain about this movie is that the sequels were atrocious and painful. This is often looked over excellent movie that puts many other in the genre to shame. Many of you who find it boring are just gore junkies who thrive off of cheap explosions and a plethora of bullets in the air. Take it for a man trying to survive, not bringing down a whole army.",4
Rambo,"Smart, well-plotted, action-filled, ultimately moving war film about a mentally unstable Vietnam vet who returns stateside to find another war raging - one against veterans.Stallone gives a very good, understated performance - his action sequences are so realistic that it's hard to believe that no one got hurt during the filming. Dennehy is also superb as the chief pursuing officer, whose ragtag bunch of cops includes a small role for David Caruso.I really did like this movie. I liked the overarching social message, and the unexpected twists and turns that follow a pretty routine event - a sheriff rousting a drifter, getting much more than he bargained for.",5
Rambo,"One of the things that surprised me the most when I watched First Blood for the first time was that it wasn't an action film. Yes it had a lot of stunts and some action sequences but it wasn't the blow things up, in your face, guns blazing action that you might associate with Rambo films. Instead First Blood had a story...an important story...with a character that instilled itself into pop culture infamy forever and its easy to see why and how. First Blood is about stereotyping, profiling, exclusion, war and watching it nowadays makes it even more important than it was then or later on. With eye opening Vietnam films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Casualties of War and so forth First Blood did something that those films weren't able to do...take the exact same message and bring it to the mainstream public with one of the biggest stars of the day. In a way First Blood is almost shocking because essentially John Rambo is NOT the hero. I suppose he could be considered the 'anti-hero' but his actions are not saving anyone, and in fact hurting innocent people who can't possibly fight him but try to no avail anyways. Still the message is clear and it's a very story driven film with the creation of a movie icon.I'll argue with anyone, anytime...Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor AND a very talented writer. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. Stallone went way beyond the action genre and actually created John Rambo from personality and history and his movements, everything. In this first installment he laid the groundwork for Rambo. Quiet, brooding, scorned, angry, unstable, haunted, deeply emotional but buried beneath all these other emotions. I think that's a hell of a performance in my books. Brian Dennehy is Stallone's rival and does a terrific job playing the conceited and determined small town sheriff who will stop at nothing to bring Rambo down. The two of them have a terrific on screen chemistry and Dennehy is a first rate actor. Richard Crenna adds to the cast as Rambo's only true 'family' and the one person he trusts. Crenna doesn't give a lot of variation to his performance, he's just kind of there to inform everyone of what Rambo is capable of. He is sort of monotoned and straight faced but he's a Rambo series staple and the character he plays is very important.Watch the end of this film closely for John Rambo's break down in the Grocery store when Traut (Crenna) tells him ""It's over."" You know the infamous line ""Not that it's over."" Watch the scene that follows and then tell me that you're not moved and blown away by Stallone's performance. It's real and it's important. First Blood by some will be considered untouchable by the rest because they see it for what it was likely meant to be...a drama...and important drama with a message but the film makers created this incredible character and by the time the film is done you're thinking one thing; I want to see this guy in his element in the action that they speak of and then you have the serializing of Rambo (which you will see by my review is NOT a bad thing.) I suppose I'm judging First Blood on it's merit of being considered an action film because as great as Stallone is and how interesting the film is...I didn't find it mind blowingly entertaining. Still the film is well made an absolute classic and definitely worth seeing. If you're a huge Rambo fan then you can find a lot of hidden details about this mysterious man that Stallone created. It's a must see on any list. 8/10 **************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.",4
Rambo,"Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is a previous Green Beret who is forced to save himself from a redneck sheriff ( Brian Dennehy) and deputies ( Bill Mckinney , Jack Starrett, David Caruso ). Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully jailed and he pull off the break-out . The authorities set off in pursuit and he lead them into all type of dangerous , booby traps in the woods and mountains of the Oregon State . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping of innumerable risks and dangers . Former colonel (Richard Crenna) will attempt to stop and detain him .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it is fast movement for that reason the picture is quite entertaining. The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed in natural parks . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the anterior trainer officer. Appears unbilled Bruce Greenwood (JFK in Thirteen days ),almost extra ,and screen debut from David Caruso and Chris Mulkey . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by Andrew Laszlo filmed on location in Golden Ears Provincial Park,Hope, North Vancouver, Pitt Lake, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Splendid and magnificent musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith. The motion picture is followed by Rambo series : First blood II in which Rambo returns at Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war and Rambo III against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan . The trilogy was a completed by the recent Rambo , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand . The quartet was a complete success though the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans ; it's a movie for adrenaline lovers . Rating : Good , entertaining but violent . This exciting and moving motion picture is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this intelligent film still has its agreeable moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced picture attempts a special atmosphere with spectacular results. Two thumbs up",4
Rambo,"Rambo is more than a cartoon character. He is the alter-ego of a generation. However, they could just as easily have dressed him in a suit and written nearly the same script. In that way, 'Rambo' perpetuates the stereotyped Viet Nam War veteran as a semi-literate, underemployed drifting soul. Many of the clichd expressions used to describe John Rambo in the film are metaphors for the way real-life Vietnam War veteran were regarded: ""Crazy,"" ""psycho,"" ""loser,"" to name a few things that the character was called in the film. He added a few, (they called me)""...baby killer,"" ""In Nam I was somebody, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, I could drive a tank, fly a chopper. In the end, that he cried was out of character. Nonetheless, the character, 'John Rambo,' did what many of us wanted to do, and many did in their own way: Smack society down for using us and throwing us away, scorned. The interesting thing to note is that the character, Sheriff Teasley, is played by Brian Dennehy, an actor who lied about serving in Viet Nam when he did not. Among veterans, lying about service in Viet Nam is a shameful act. Yet the many who have done so in some way supports the idea that Viet Nam, in the national conscience, was a heroic venture. It was.",4
Rambo,"I, like many, have probably grown up with Rambo being a part of popular culture. From all those references to such an iconic character I was expecting some war film centered around an unstoppable killing machine. I was completely wrong, and thankfully so. Rambo is the story of a dark and troubled man. Rambo isn't a hero, but he should have been. He's a man that came home with no one to welcome him. He drifts from town to town, antagonised wherever he goes. One day a police force pushes him too far. Rambo's mental instabilities take hold and he pledges a war against these men in authority. There are no clearcut villains, and certainly no heroes here. We empathise with Rambo, and understand the police action taken against him. As well as being a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam Vets, it also shows how war isn't an excuse for such violent actions. Dennehy's wonderful character is shown (very subtly) as a soldier that managed to find his path. At the same time Dennehy doesn't know when to quit, his pride getting in the way. This is an action film with real substance, real issues, and real discussions to be had. It also never fails to deliver on the action, and Stallone's final emotional breakdown will relate to anyone that's been pushed too far. A film focused mostly on understanding, not excusing. I regret waiting this long to watch it.",5
Rambo,First Blood is that rare film that is not black and white instead it deals with areas of Gray. Stallone's Acting is Very Good maybe the Finest he's ever done outside of F.I.S.T. And Yet while his Rambo is a compelling portrait of a man slowly going insane trying to find something resembling peace. Rambo never finds it. All he finds is hatred and fear aimed at him and that makes them hostile towards him. The Main Villain in this if you can call him one is Police Chief Wil Teasle wonderfully played by Brian Dennehy. The interaction between the two is tense and that's before the shooting starts. But this is Stallone's movie and his Tour de force as he creates a complex character that many have a hard time separating from the Real Stallone. Richard Crenna Steals the Show as Colonel Sam Trautman United States Special Forces coming all the way from fort Bragge to come get his boy. Crenna underplays his role cool as anyone has a right to be. Together this cast sets off a match headed towards Kegs of Gunpowder and dynamite First Blood does not disappoint and it will stay with you long after you've seen it.,5
Rambo,My Rating : 8/10I am a huge fan of Sly and this right here is one of his best!This is my childhood movie I grew up with and will always have a special place in my heart. They drew first blood. THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD.,4
Rambo,"This is one of those films that was hugely popular back in the eighties but for some reason simply fell by the wayside and has effectively been forgotten about. Okay, while it isn't the movie that catapulted Stallone into stardom (that was Rocky), it certainly helped. Mind you, it is also one of the movies that also Stallone as a stereotypical tough guy that speaks more with his fists than with his mouth. However, as a film it is quite good, and certainly much better than the three sequels that came after it. In fact the sequels seemed to toss the whole purpose of this film to simply turn Rambo into your typical action hero whose job is to go out and rescue people.Anyway, the movie is about a former special forces officer who served in Vietnam but upon returning to America has simply become a drifter. In fact everybody who he knew as a family have simply died leaving him effectively alone in the world. So, he simply drifts from place to place, however one of those places happens to be a small town called Hope, and the Sheriff decides that he doesn't particularly want people like Rambo wandering through his town so he forcefully has him removed, and when Rambo doesn't comply he arrests him, takes him to the station and roughs him up a bit.Well, that happens to be a bad move because not only does it trigger a number of flash backs, but it also causes him to snap, beat up all of the occupants of the police station, and then flee into the mountains. Well, being the cocky small town police that they are they decide to go after Rambo alone, but pretty quickly discovered that that is definitely not a good idea since he takes out each and every one of them. Then, when the cavalry is called in, he not only manages to escape their trap, but takes the fight into town where we come to the dramatic conclusion.First Blood isn't your typical action movie by a long shot. Okay, you do technically have the bad guys in the form of the police, but the thing is that these police aren't corrupt in the sense that some police officers are but rather they are simply protective of their town to the point that they will push strangers around and politely ask them to leave if it seems as if they are going to cause trouble. Well, the problem is that when you push the wrong person around it has the potential to come back and bite you.The thing with this film is that it is about how the Vietnam Vets were treated when they returned home from war. It wasn't the heroes welcome that the WWII vets received, but rather they were ignored, and in some sense blamed, for the failure in Vietnam. This was America and they don't lose wars, but Vietnam was an effective loss, so it must have been the troops who were the reason that they lost. The thing is that this was a different type of war, and one that they Americans didn't adapt to at the time (though past experiences have demonstrated that they can fight a guerrilla war). However, that is not the issue in the film, it is the treatment of the vets that is.In a way they were left on the trash heap of society, and when they were able to pick themselves up out of it they were once again blamed for where they landed up. In many cases it was the World War II vets that were looking down on them because they too had been to war, and they had managed to transition back into civilian life, so if the Vietnam Vets weren't able to then maybe they weren't trying hard enough. However, as mentioned, Vietnam was a different type of war and as such the experiences that the Vets had over there were different to those that the WWII vets faced.Some people simply label First Blood as a mindless action film, but I would say that it is much, much more than that. It doesn't end the way a mindless action film ends, but rather confronts us with the alienation that Vietnam Vets face in the United States. It also confronts us with the bigotry of small town America, though you are no doubt going to find that in many small communities the world over. It challenges us to how we should look at working with our vets, and attempting to seek solutions to these problems than simply sweeping them under the rug. The thing is that no doubt there are going to be similar issues in relation to the vets of the Iraq War, and things no doubt have the potential to be much worse for them due to the hypercapitalist nature of the modern world.",4
Password,"""Password"" was one of those rare game shows in which contestants had to rely on mental abilities *other* than memory. Contestants on games such as ""Jeopardy"" and ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" rely on their memories, or those of others, to come up with answers.Unfortunately, the game placed people who do not have a great command of the English language at a disadvantage. People who have English as a second language may not have done too well in this game.Nevertheless, ""Password"" demanded that the contestant make an intellectual effort to take a word (idea) and convey it someone else. That kind of effort takes imagination and insight in the nuances of language to do well. It's a cerebral game; maybe that's why Allen Ludden said: ""Some time, somewhere, some day there will be another game show, but never one with the class of this one.""",0
Password,"Every saturday, I watch the reruns of Password on Game Show Network.  I think this is a fun game to play and I like to make up my own games and play it with my family.  Allen Ludden (God rest his soul) was a very good host too.",0
Password,"Alan Ludden was truly a class act. One of a very few of the great game show hosts like Bill Cullen and Tom Kennedy. Password was a show that required the contestants to at least have a vocabulary--something that's sadly missing in today's game show world.I remember the last episode of Mr. Ludden's tenure--they drank champagne on air. Can anybody help me on this?: I was very young, but I seem to remember one of those 5 word bonus rounds they played with George Peppard--8 seconds! Am I right? Was this the record? Can't find any internet or you tube references. Anyone? Bueller?",5
Password,"Password was definitely a true classic as a well as a pioneer in the game show genre. It had all the elements for success. A simple format, home audience participation (if you didn't look at the word on the screen) and an outstanding host in Allen Ludden. He was the best game show host of all-time since he kept the game moving, treated both the celebrities and contestants very well and showed a lot of class. He was also one of the best dressed emcees and one of the first to wear open shirts.As a game show pioneer, Password was the first to pair contestants with celebrities and the first to use a bonus round, Without Password, there would have been no Pyramid. Both games were created by Bob Stewart.The original version would have lasted longer if CBS wouldn't have preempted the show on the same day The Newlywed Game debuted for a Vietnam War news conference. The Chuck Barris show cut into Password's dominance. Also, Fred Silverman, who headed CBS Daytime Programming was not a fan of game shows and he killed off classics such as I've Got a Secret, What's My Line and Password. But fear not, the game was the first to air reruns and that led to the 70s revival on ABC.As for the 70s version, it was also ground breaking. It was the first network game show to be revived, though Goodson-Todman survived through a network game show drought with syndicated versions of What's My Line, To Tell the Truth and Beat the Clock and it was also the company's first show to be produced in Hollywood. When Password returned in 1971, the main game and Lightning Round remained the same. The only change was the addition of the Betting Word, where a contestant can double their winnings by guessing another password in 15 seconds. There was also an updated set and new theme music and of course, Allen Ludden as host. This version was a success for three years before the format became old and tired. Instead of cancelling the show, the producers changed the format and title to Password All Stars. An outstanding game was ruined by more complicated rules and the fact that game show fans like to see real people win money instead of celebrities playing for charities. Even Allen Ludden was uncomfortable with the new format. Eventually, the show went back to using civilian contestants but the game was still too complicated and was cancelled in June 1975. I'll always remember Allen Ludden closing each show with ""The password for today is...""",0
Password,"First off, I must say that this is a fun game show. Also, since I'm 24, I haven't seen every episode. However, I do know the show very well. Every time I've watched it, I've had a lot of fun playing along and watching. Despite the fact that it's finished its run, this makes me long to be a contestant. The thing I like most about it are the questions. Despite the fact that I don't know that many answers, I still have fun playing along. I hope the Game Show Network keeps it on so I can play along and watch again. If that happens, I will be really happy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",4
Password,"When I first discovered that ""Password"" reruns were airing on GSN a few years ago, I made it a point to get as many episodes on VHS as I could since there's no telling when the entire series will go into DVD. It's a pity that a lot of the game shows run on GSN don't have the class and continuity that ""Password"" did. Allen Ludden was always a great host - perfect for a game show like this. And like a lot of the game shows in the sixties and seventies, they made you think. I can also thank whoever made the decision at CBS to hang on to some of these great programs of that era such as ""Password"" for people to enjoy over again. I don't think the contestants were ever overawed by their celebrity partners and naturally we all found out how human they can be trying to think of a word to say in a few seconds from one-word clues. AND DON'T EVER SAY THE PASSWORD AS A CLUE...OOPS!!!!",5
Password,"The excitement and fun of a retro game show can be found in ""Password,"" the famous TV game show where two teams, ""$100,000 Pyramid"" style, try to win big bucks. One person reads out a clue on a folded up piece of paper while the other person tries to guess the word. There are up to five clues revealed on the board above, and one team must figure out what the actual word really is!!!!! And now, my two favorite variations that currently run on GSN:""Password Plus:"" It stars Allen Ludden, who looked (no offense) really awful, like he always wore a raincoat to the show or something. Anyways, it had the most colorful set, and it had ""Alphabetics,"" which gave the contestant a chance at big bucks!!!!! I once saw a man go through it fast and correctly about a week ago and that was awesome!!!!!""Super Password:"" It stars Bert Convy and the set looked different, like a huge NES system; almost! Everything's the same, except that there's ""Ca$hword"" now. I also like how the word appears on screen and the noise that accompanies it!!!!!C'mon, folks!!!!! These versions of ""Password"" meant good entertainment for everyone; this is stuff our parents (and us as little children) watched when they just got married!!!!! So watch them on GSN or else!!!!!10 stars",5
Terminator,"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10",5
Terminator,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.",5
Terminator,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. ""  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.",5
Terminator,"Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character's single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we're appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it's the film's anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story: the cops can't get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I'll give it a 10.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic. The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement. The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.5/5 stars",5
Terminator,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier.""  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It's quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?9.5 out of 10.",5
Terminator,"For the gift of `Aliens' and `The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's `Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy: he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8/10.",0
Terminator,"Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this.",5
Terminator,"Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",5
Terminator,"There are actors,and there are movie stars.Arnold Schwarzenegger is without question a movie star,because every time he is on screen, he is,well,Arnold.There is a different Arnold in this film,and this     is what I like about it.He,for once,is playing the villain,and to perfection,I might add.He makes for one of the best screen villains ever in cinema history.It's a pity that his ""good guy"" image won't allow him to play the bad seed more often,but that's Hollywood, I guess.Aside from the thrilling sequel,this is perhaps Arnold's best work.",5
Terminator,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",5
Terminator,"The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:1. When the terminator killed Ginger & her boyfriend.2. Shootout at the nightclub (A classic scene in film history).3. Self surgery on his wrist & eye.4. Shootout at the police station.5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.The line ""I'll be back"" is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000, 000/10. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street & Predator, the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator.",5
Terminator,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.This is the one that started it all! Arnold is excellent in it! Linda Hamilton was great! Michael Biehn was very good as the good guy! Paul Winfield was good! Lance Hendrickson played a different character! In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action, sci-fi, or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!Movie Nuttball's NOTES:There is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something, she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader, Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson, and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich, in Aliens as Bishop, Alien 3 as Bishop II, and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson, believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this: In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!",5
Terminator,"I don't like action movies generally, and had to be coaxed into seeing this one by a friend.  It was a major and pleasant surprise to me, and I left it with questions beyond the scope of the film, which always happens with the ones I really like (ie, Did John know who Reese was/would be when he sent him?).  Most of all, I left it a Michael Biehn fan; he is great in this movie.",4
Terminator,"The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear. Or perhaps the scene in the club where Reese first engages the Terminator, either way ingenious and unforgettable moments in film history.A classic in every way.",5
Terminator,This is a true 80s classic and I personally like it more than T2 (even though T2 is also amazing) The action sequences are awesome and Sarah Conner is pretty hot.,5
Terminator,"Watch it if you haven't.

Terminator,"I don't know if The Terminator is the best sci-fi/action film ever made by anyone, but if it's not...then I don't know what is.I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4, and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart, so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines, who have also sent back a ""terminator"" to kill this woman, named Sarah Conner.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back, kill some punks (Bill Paxon is one of them!) rob a gun store, and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime, the man is sent back, chased by the police, steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes, and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah, she is a fumbling waitress...not ""the mother of the future"".When the terminator, the man (named Kyle Reese), and Sarah Conner all come together, we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slow-motion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point, anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shoot-out (Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie), then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times, thrown through a window, hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone (even some who have not see the movie) knows the famous line ""I'll be back"", which is said just before the terminator ""visits the police station"", if you know what I mean. At this point, Sarah and Kyle are at the police station, so they're safe, right? ""There's thirty cops in this building"", so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later, everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.James Cameron's directing is outstanding, especially considering the $6,400,000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects, which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are, in parts, better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure, there's many parts which are out-dated as hell, but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding, not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real, not a cgi effect (but the stop-motion scenes look AWFUL).Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film, it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron. Add a script that is commonly used as a teaching tool for upcoming screenwriters and you have a spectacular film.The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching it today, it makes you sad that nobody working today can make anything as good.",5
Terminator,"The people who say Judgement Day is better than The Terminator are wrong. This is soooo good there's no topping it. I liked the entire trilogy a lot, but there's no comparing to this first one. It's a brainless action film, but it's not entirely brainless. Excellent world building makes it fascinating to explore, and begs for the two sequels.Even though it is sort of over the top in all of the action, it's just a really fun movie to see. Greatest pure action movie ever. Period.And Arnold is better as the bad guy. Just sayin'.",5
KaaGaR,Thrilling yet beautifully directed by makarand mane and rinku rajguru as always she is amazing,5
KaaGaR,"This is becoming the new trend that, take a rural location, rural script, rural language, and rustic abusive characters etc.. Sairat was one of a kind, so was fandry, it was more of a substantial type of craft, not just a film drama. There was a message, there was reality, there was superstition and the behavior towards the lower caste people.This movie kaagar tries to implicate the rural format drama, but its more of a imposed drama than a substance. And many times it seems like the director tried to imitate the sairat movie scenes. Thats now even possible to the sairat's director himself now. That film is over, done, it cannot be repeated in any manner whatsoever.. Yes make the rural area related films, but unlike any other film, which doesn't resemble any other movie at all, here the biggest mistake director made was that he took the same actress from the previous movie sairat, which was a super duper hit, and it completely seemed like its the imitation and not an original film.",1
KaaGaR,"KAAGAR REVIEW :-
Makarand Mane was a name to remember for classic film 'Ringan'. Then he had forgettable project 'Youngraad' which can barely be called mediocre. Kaagar was that perfect opportunity to come back strongly where Production Value, Cast, Overall impression and almost everything falling at right place. The opportunity is missed and how? By far, actually. One would have never expected it to be such disaster but gotto move on now.Kaagar lacks the basic ornaments of writing, and the logic as well. The writer seemed confused asking himself questions like whether is it a Love Story or a political drama or a what else? The script has a story to tell about Rani (Rinku Rajguru), Yuvraj (Shubhankar Tawde) and Guruji (Shashank Shende) changing thier basic perspective continuesly. At one moment it looks like a smooth going love story, suddenly it turns into a political drama and then again turns the genre to thriller/suspense (not exactly). And what do we get as a final output? A Clueless Film. Moving towards the acting zone, the trio Rinku Rajguru, Shubhankar Tawde and Shashank Shende easily sells it on thier acting. Even other cast members put thier best. Screenplay is not that long and thank God it's not, those 120 minutes passes without any boring moments if you can forgive the basic writing. Action and violent scenes are damn realistic and perhaps the best part of the film. Music too passes quickly keeping the pace intact. Decency of cinematography and locations is has been kept. Makarand Mane's Direction is completely Lost. One can still remember his Ringan and that class for some years but here you don't see a single glimpse of that class.Too much of cinematic liberty and fictitious vision of writer+director has taken Kaagar far away from common sense. It does not really give you any reason to give it watch, neither it win as Love Story nor as Political Drama. The basics has to get right otherwise you never come in a race, Ringan is that Horse which never comes in a race yet fails. You keep searching for at least one reason to call it a Good film and the search never ends.RATING- 4/10*",2
Shazam!,"They must have superhero fatigue. Why? This movie is at the very least comparable to every other. Here's what this movie has:First, a lot of really genuinely good comedy. You aren't going to laugh at dirty jokes, you aren't going to laugh at corny jokes, you're going to laugh at genuinely well written and performed comedy. In fact, probably soon to be one of the most iconic comedic moments in superhero movies to date with Shazam and his foe.Second, this movie has more than one cameo. The entire team did a great job of keeping a secret cameo (and it's not the one that people might think of at the very end).Third, this has such a great portrayal of Foster families. Very often movies have these really negative, terrible portrayals of Foster kids and the families they go into. The family that Billy gets into genuinely care about each other. It's easy to see why Billy would want to accept them. Especially after you find out some information which I will not reveal here.One common criticism is that this movie forces drama between the comedic parts and that it doesn't work well. This is only somewhat true. The drama is believable, but it's a little forced, but let me play devil's advocate. We have gotten very used to incredibly great dramas, but not every movie can have this. It's a superhero movie. In all honesty, the drama in most superhero movies always comes second. It is never really THAT captivating. This shouldn't be held up to the standard of great dramas films. Really, no superhero movie should. With that being said, I find the motivation for the villain to be persuasive. Imagine that you are a child that is being bullied. Typically if you cannot rely on your family and friends to help, you're going to probably grow up with anger in your heart. In this case, he has no friends and his family ARE the bullies. Someone criticized this, but they're completely wrong. That's a strong motivation to be someone who wants to take his anger out on others (especially family).Another thing I love about this movie is that Billy is never really just motivated to start doing good. He shows that he is willing to do good. He protects Freddy from being beat up, but only when it's gone too far. He's chosen by the Wizard not because he is some perfect, good-hearted child, but because he has the potential to be exactly that. The fact that he's willing to protect Freddy from bullies and that he gets his powers, then doesn't immediately start to save everyone shows the writers knew exactly what they were doing. This isn't some shortcut to being a good person. It doesn't show that he does all of the very funny things he does just to.make the audience last. He's learning. He's still not perfect. It's only when he has to save people from a problem that he created that he even remotely starts to start trying to understand the responsibility he carries. It's not until he begins to accept his foster family as his real family does he really understand the importance of helping others. You have to remember that he's always been a loner. He's never really experienced love since.. well, you'll see, but NEVER. In fact, I don't even think he's fully understood by the end of the movie. He's still learning. And why wouldn't he be? He's only 14.
This movie is absolutely great. It's much more than okay. It's honestly better than most comic book movies I've seen in awhile, but for different reasons than the other traditional superhero movies (like I said, this movie has those traditional elements, but also much more). The only way that it is ""just okay"" is if you have some serious superhero fatigue.",5
Shazam!,"I'm not sure why people are rating this movie with anything below a 6 stars. My guess is that some people are too engrossed in whether or not the CGI was perfect or too much into details. The movie was pretty true to the comics and had a pretty good storyline and acting.I went with my kids and wife and we all enjoyed it. If you are a comic book freak that is mindful of every little detail then you will most likely find bones to pick with this movie, but if you just want to watch an enjoyable movie, then this one's for you. It's not dark like most DC movies, has action and is funny at times.",4
Shazam!,"Seriously can't believe how much I loved this movie! This felt like a proper superhero movie felt when I was a kid, they captured the perfect tone, can't fault it.",5
Shazam!,"I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's Taika Waititi. He's this movie director that really isn't known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off tremendously. He helps some light shine into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't jolty like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.The writing was uneven, but definitely fun. It's a basic story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is well-timed and consistently funny; a lot of meta jokes and inner humor help the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships written in are heartfelt and the story itself has a lot of heart. One part that causes a rift is the central character of Billy. His two versions, between the adult and the kid, seem to be two completely different people. It's an inconsistency that's fine being just about the only part (besides typical villain problems) that bugs you about the writing.Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carries childlike enthusiasm and a heart in effortlessly. He oozes charisma and really... I won't be able to say it enough so here it is: Zachary Levi is perfection. The rest... Kid Billy was somewhat toned down but still played quite nicely. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser (Grazer? I'm sorry I don't remember off the top of my head), were VERY good. Child actors really are improving. Any other supporting performance was played nicely and everyone knew who the real star of the movie was: I'm sorry, I'm gonna keep coming back to this: Zachary Levi is a national treasure.What else... music was nice and heartfelt, I talked about the action sequences... every other part of this film is mainly there to add to Billy's story and I like it. The world is undeniably fun and we're not really pulled out of it.The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like Shazam! (9/10)",5
Shazam!,"I am quite disappointed that some of you guys felt that this movie is not even worth 1 star. How is it possible ? Seriously to me is very funny throughout the movie. This movie also suits family to watch together. Even though the story line is NOT as strong as other movie, but hey, the hilarious part makes this movie very interesting and NOT dull at all. Very RARE to see a super hero behaving in a comedy way...lol. Conclusion, worth to go watch at movie theater ! 10/10",5
Shazam!,"I went into this a little sceptical and found I came out rather chuffed with such a good film. Far far better than I was expecting and pleased I had gone to a preview screener for this.The acting is spot on, the comedy is spot on and the action is.... You guessed it, spot on. I certainly recommend any super hero fan to go watch this and big praised to WB for leaving this alone and letting the DIrector get on with it.",5
Shazam!,"It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.",4
Shazam!,"This movie is just perfect in every way and very different compared to other superhero films. Trailers barely show anything. There are so many surprises (no, I'm not just talking about some little cameo, I'm talking about main stuff). Also if you feel that most superhero films are showing similar stuff and want something new then this is for you and those who enjoy every superhero films anyway then it's definitely for you. And even those who don't like superhero films at all, will also love it.",5
Shazam!,"I saw the trailer and I thought- genius a superhero that's actually a kid!
Think, Tom Hanks' ""Big"" meets Superman (1978).
I remember liking Shazam as a kid in the 80's (it took me a long time to call him Capt Marvel) but not much else I remember.
So I watched the 1940's serial & was impressed, so I watched the 1970's tv show and although cheesy was entertaining, so I moved onto the 1980's filmation series and fell in love with that.
This renaissance I had with Shazam only happened 5 months ago too!
Shazam! (2019) has all that 40's/70's/80's elements mixed together.
The bad guys look awesome, the movie has lots of laughs and tons of heart.
One bad thing: there is 1 short scene (parent scene) that gets too dark - it made me feel uncomfortable...it kinda pulled me out of the movie but thank god it's a short scene cuz this is one of my favorite comic book movies ever.
1. Batman 1989
2. Dark Knight
3. Superman 2
4. CA Civil War
5. Shazam!",5
Shazam!,"Technically a 6.5, but definitely not anything to be thrilled about, as there isn't much novelty. I'm not familiar with the comics so I had no special expectations. I can honestly say it was a fun movie, but I just don't see where the glowing praise is coming from.Story-wise, it does its job without much surprise or imagination. The little drama with Billy searching for his long-lost mom, while being unable to accept companionship from others, is alright. The special FX are good, but there aren't any mindblowing scenes (no real fighting or magic other than smoke and lightning). I didn't mind the villain being one-note, but I wish they did something better than the old ""7 deadly sins,"" or at the very least been more creative with the designs (which look like clay concept models of generic gargoyles and you couldn't even tell which sin was which).Maybe I'm just cynical, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure I had a few smirks and chuckles now and then, but there wasn't anything roaringly hilarious. If the trailers didn't exactly make you LOL, then you'd probably won't within the full movie. The comparisons to a kid-friendly Deadpool are apt, but without the wackiness that ""seals the deal"" as most of the jokes are simple/cheesy/cheap (At the very beginning, Billy steals a cop's lunch bag while he pleads against it. Later on he uses his adult form to buy beer and visit a strip club like every teenage boy's wishes. That's pretty much the bar of humor throughout, besides the numerous ""Look what I can do!"" moments of discovery for the powers.)There's a large disconnect between the ever-brooding Billy and the upbeat Shazam, almost like a reverse Jekyll/Hyde. I'd be pretty stoked too if I suddenly gained superpowers, but neither character is a natural extension. And except for Freddy, everyone is entirely one-dimensional and stereotypical: overly enthusiastic foster parents, the tech-wizard gamer Asian, the sweet 16-type daughter going off to college, bullies, etc. Billy has probably less than 10 minutes shown interacting with the fosters that him eventually accepting them as family is a giant, unsatisfying leap.Overall, it's highly forgettable, but kids will enjoy it, assuming they won't be affected by the CG monsters.",3
Shazam!,"Well acted, directed and written, but the ending fight scene was too dragged out. The film was primarily an infantile plunge into the superhero world, but nevertheless great for the younger demographics, who could relate better than the usual string of caped crusaders. The plot and comedy was a little cheesy, but kids love Mac n Cheese right? Enjoyable mindless entertainment for the entire family. 8/10 from me",4
Shazam!,Joyous fun from beginning to end. Kudos to Zachary Levi for his superb portrayal of a childish superhero.,5
Shazam!,"Shazam was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. If you either a comic book fan or not regardless you will enjoy it from start to end. Although Shazam doesn't contain as much fighting scenes you would see in movies these days it still leaves you with a fully polished story and character development. Shazam shows a teenage kid that gets powers and what he uses it for and obviously its typical things teenage kids would do. If you are plotting on whether or not to go, the obvious answer is YES!",5
Shazam!,"I am a DC fan. When I was a kid, tens of thousands of years ago, I read DC (I think, back then, it might have been National Periodicals) exclusively. I loved it. But in later years I read several Marvel graphic novels and then the movies came along and, with some exceptions, I loved them. I still prefer the DC TV universe but most of the movies have ranged from ok to ""really?""Then Captain Sparklefingers (see the movie for the reference) and I was blown away.Like Marvel, it's set in a real city (Philadelphia). It's not Gotham or Metropolis or Coast City.It's not grim. It's not ""Deadpool"" funny but I spent a lot of time smiling. It takes itself seriously enough to be interesting but not so seriously that the plot gets weighed down.It even has a pair of post-credit scenes!It anchors itself firmly in the DC universe, with references to other characters but it's enough to be charming and not so much that the film gets weighed down by their angst.This is probably my favorite DC movie since ""Wonder Woman."" Check it out.",5
Shazam!,I saw this in the early screening and when I left the theatre I was overjoyed and smiling through because Indidnt expect it to be a fun adventure and a good action movie.This movie definitely touched my Soul!!! Good job DC,5
Shazam!,"Zachary Levi stars as a superhero incarnation in this above average superhero blockbuster about a teenage foster child in Philadelphia who discovers his calling as a bona fide superhero. Asher Angel is solid as the teenage superhero-to-be, but he is considerably upstaged by a Jack Dylan Grazer who gives a likeable performance as his aspiring sidekick. Mark Strong is menacing as the human vessel for the seven deadly sins.Rousing and funny, this film is great entertainment although I do wonder how much a medium for children it truly is. It has many tense scenes of mayhem and the portrayal of the seven deadly sins might scare some children. The aspect of foster care is sympathetically portrayed here and adds to the film's genuineness.The film does take a while to take shape, in keeping with the mindset of a teenage boy just beginning to discover his true potential, but its payoff is tremendous. It goes from decent to superior as it becomes a classic battle of good and evil. This is a welcome addition to the superhero genre. Gladly recommended.",4
Shazam!,"Unfortunately a little weak and all over the place. Good story, good start and than just fell flat. Watched in cinema, couldn't wait for it to finish.",2
Shazam!,The Film Is purely amazing and Zachary Levi born for The Role 100%,5
Shazam!,"Great movie, another perspective of superhero, superhero with magic",5
Shazam!,"Great Movie! THANK YOU DC, THANK YOU WB.......................................

If you visit a Sikh Akhada where they practice martial art you would exactly see what Akshay has done. He has brought out the true Sikh Martial Art essence. The slow motion is not over the top because it is exactly how they fight.

Kesari,"Kesari was one of the most awaiting movie of these year which is based on the Battle of Saragarhi was fought on 12 September 1897 between Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army and Pashtun Orakzai tribesmen (legions of Afghans). It occurred in the North-West Frontier Province, (modern-day Khyber Paktunkhwa, Pakistan). The Sikhs, led by Halvindar Ishar Singh, chose to fight to the death, which is considered as one of history's bravest battle ever fought.No doubt Akshay Kumar has given many of the best performances in his Career, but these one is Outstanding, one of the best. Akki in portray of Halvindar Ishar Singh nailed it. Parineeti Chopra is good in Special performances. Rakesh Chaturvedi Om is superb in negative performance, you will really hate him in role of Saidullah.Director Anurag Singh has done very good job. Action Pack Scenes are heart of the movie. Action Director Parvez Shaikh & Lawrence Woodward have done execellent work. Cinematography is fantastic by Anshul Chobey. Climax is really awesome, will left you in emotions and make you proud to be an Indian too.Overall, Kesari is an Action packed & Heart touching movie. Its a treat for Holi & these weekend.

great sounds.. i don't like songs in movies so that that as a salt.overall great movie. everyone should watch it",5
Luka Chuppi,"The movie starts with a statement from a superstar that he is living in a live-in relationship, the opposition of which is then taken up by right-wing political parties as their election motto, and this same topic pops up in almost every second conversation in the film, no matter what the original dialogue is about. This makes the whole movie feel like a heavily scripted low class drama. The only thing that's keeping it afloat is a good performance by the actress. Karthik Aryan, on the other hand, fails to impress with his sad, always dejected but suddenly excited character, as he did with his previous films. What really sinks this film for me, however, is the forced humor spread throughout the movie which might appeal to the mass audience but actually has very little weight in terms of real comedy. All in all, a film to skip, in my opinion. It's only two hours, but feels like much more, especially when you are sitting in there wondering what people around you are laughing and cheering about.",2
Luka Chuppi,Movie is senseless. It's one time watch but not for everyone.,2
Luka Chuppi,"Be warned ! Don't have high expectation from this type of film. This is a normal family drama with very much Predictable plot that you will feel why it is happening like this when it can be sorted in numerous ways (if u were in the shoes of guddu also) this was the first film of Kartik that i didn't able to enjoy only Pankaj Tripathi performance was good. At one pointy of the film you will feel why they are stretching this short story to a long version.
OkaY I understand that the theme of the film is somewhat Unique not like a typical bollywood movie but it can be presented in a very Beautiful way also which Director failed to execute.
Many times we the MOVIEGOERS watch a film that have a good story line and good execution if this both thing is not equally maintain then we get upset. And in the case of Lukka Chuppi neither of them was executed well.
May this film was not my cup of tea and maybe i was too harsh but HONESTLY it was the true words from my perspective ....",2
Luka Chuppi,This movie lacks in story and direction. They were just dragging the live in relationship subject and doing nonsense things. Only good thing in this movie is acting of Pankaj Tripathi and Chote Miyan acting,1
Luka Chuppi,"Luka Chuppi is a tiresome tale of a couple from Mathura, Guddu and Rashmi, who decide to experiment with a live-in relationship. They do this by pretending to be married. And all that can go wrong does.The writing by Rohan Shankar is consistently feeble. Scenes are stretched endlessly and the humour is limp. The comic flourishes are underlined by annoyingly loud background music, which cues us to laugh but so little of Luka Chuppi is actually funny.Lukka Chuppi features five remixes which is a sign of the larger issue with the film - there just isn't enough freshness or flair here.Luka Chuppi isn't without its moments, but its downside overwhelms its strengths by a big margin. It offers shallow entertainment at best. Watch the film only if that is good enough for you.Laxman Utekar's Luka Chuppi explores the concept of live-in relationships in small-town Mathura and Gwalior, where they are heavily frowned upon. However, despite having top-notch performances and hilarious moments, the film leaves much to be desired as it only manages to scratch the surface.But what really makes 'Luka Chuppi' an entertaining watch is the nuanced writing by Rohan Ghoge and its execution. The first half is swift and packed with funny moments that end in an unpredictable twist. The second half too, is marked by quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.Overall, 'Luka Chuppi' is a fun ride that never gets too preachy or uncomfortable for the family audience. It's a clean entertainer with a message that's not too loud, but clear, for sure.Rohan Shankar's story is novel and entertaining and different from other such films in this genre. The characters are very well fleshed out and most importantly, they are relatable. Rohan Shankar's screenplay is effective for most parts and evokes the right humour. At some places however, it is a bit weak, especially in the first half.On the whole, LUKA CHUPPI is a funny take on the modern relationships laced with dollops of situational and funny moments. This clean comedy would get thumbs up not just from the youngsters but also from the family audiences. Recommended!Be warned, 'Luka Chuppi' isn't a life-altering romantic comedy which sets out to make some grave social comment. It's a light-hearted film - with a scattered, almost fickle, storyline - bolstered by good performances from a sturdy cast. While you may not put a ring on this one, you can definitely live with it for a couple of hours of your life.",2
Luka Chuppi,"LUKA CHUPPI REVIEW -
Luka Chupi wasn't looking convincing from the trailer itself, that actually helped to keep the expectations lower and not to feel much disappointed. A desi Film with Simple story and Light Comedy is always welcome but what if an Ordinary Script goes even more ordinary and then Light moments goes in vain because of unnecessary fiasco created in the screenplay? Not Good, huhhh. That's what Luka Chuppi is.From the Trailer we got an idea that the Film tells the story of Live In Relationship and Marriage fiasco in Funny style, but in film there are some more factors like Politics, Emotions and Youth Generation thinking in addition. The basic conviction goes wrong here that what exactly
Director wanted to say? Was he confused while focusing on multiple subjects in one script? It seems that, he was. Making sense is always important, no matter if you are telling big story or small one and that doesn't happen here. Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon shows Good Chemistry on screen, the supporting cast is good too. Pankaj Tripathi is a Show stealer who brings Gauranteed Laughters whenever he is present on screen. Music is a Plus point but all are recreations therefore credit goes to the originals. Screenplay has many goofs, writing includes unnecessary elements, Dialogues are decent. Direction is Immature and confused which could have been much much better. The vision was Overgeneral.As a whole, Luka Chuppi is a Below Average film, apart from some real, genuine Laughters there is nothing more in the dish. That USP thing is missing which gives an Identity to any film. Hit songs and Startcast might help but still Box Office Success of the Film is doubtful. A better director with better vision and this one would have been a Good Light Hearted Comedy, but for now it is less for sure.RATING- 4/10*",2
Luka Chuppi,"Luka Chuppi stars Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon in the lead with Pankaj Tripathi, Vinay Pathak, Aparshakti Khurana and others.fans have been buzzing about the scintillating on-screen chemistry between Kartik and Kriti. The songs too, especially the remake of '90's song - Poster Lagwa Do, has become a fan favourite.The humour element in the film lands on point every now and then. And the best part, the humour is more situational than slapstick.Luka Chuppi explores the story of a young couple who wanted to try being in a 'live-in relationship' before getting married.what really makes 'Luka Chuppi' an entertaining watch is the nuanced writing by Rohan Ghoge and its execution. The first half is swift and packed with funny moments that end in an unpredictable twist. The second half too, is marked by quite a few laugh-out-loud moments. At some point, the humour becomes repetitive, but it's the short run-time that comes to the film's rescue. Film's two most popular songs (Coca-Cola & Poster) are thrown in at the end, during the credit roll.Overall, 'Luka Chuppi' is a fun ride that never gets too preachy or uncomfortable for the family audience. It's a clean entertainer with a message that's not too loud, but clear, for sure.",3
Luka Chuppi,I admit that there was I hype for this movie especially after Aaryan's fame in Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety and even I had my some level of excitement for this. But the movie was too chaotic and the story wasn't stable and the characters were feeling pretty messed up in themselves. The only bit positive thing in the whole drama was the songs (even they all were remake) that to some extent lit the mood. I am not sure even if this is a One Time Watch but have it your money spent on this hyped but disappointing Rom-Com..,2
Luka Chuppi,"This movie make you sit first to last with a laugh-ting riot and situational humor. The concept that is 'live-in relationship' is very relatable to new generation. This film does not show live-in but it shows how a boy and girl wants to get this type of relation,than they have lots of problem. Basically it is not very common in india. Family does not accept this type of relationships, than how couple face this problem and the film shows it situation wise very humorously. Execution was good and the acting is very commendable. Cinematography was too good. The film actually very entertaining. So very worth watching movie to get humongous entertainment.",5
Luka Chuppi,Immature directions and childish play. Waste of time. No humor timing nor any captive scene. Bogus repetitive plot. Not expected from the good cast to sign up for this one.,1
Luka Chuppi,REALLY LAUGHED A LOT. A NICE MESSAGE AT THE END! Sweet romantic funny and heart warming!,5
Luka Chuppi,Garbage movie...plz dont go plz plz...if u r going coz of karthik aaryan then plz dont...its worst movie of kartik aaryan,2

Kachindo,"After seeing The Scent of Green Papaya, I was not expecting much, just a vehicle for Catherine Deneuve.  And while it most definitely is that, it is also so much more.The stunning cinematography, the elegant score, and the epic love story set against the turbulent colonial times.  I was quite taken with the myriad plot twists.  Too bad our high schooler has a 3minute attention span.This is a very real depiction of colonialism.  One reviewer noted the maternalism of Deneuve's character while pointing out the brutality of the slave sellers.  People expecting a total condemnation of colonialism or a total condemnation of communism just don't see the gray between the black and white.  Unfortunately, only Europeans could have made this movie.  There is no didactic viewpoint, which is why some Americans don't react well to it.    While the ending is a bit flat, it still doesn't detract from the fact that this was a great movie.One of the little pleasures of this movie is listening to the Vietnamese housemaid's pidgin French and reading the subtitled translation.   While movies like The Scent of Green Papaya are wonderful and deserve all the accolades they are accorded, this movie is very underrated.  Green Papaya is a nice cultural experience but it can't come close to Indochine for grit and history.  3 1/2 stars out of 4.",0
Kachindo,"I thought it was good, if over-long. I've been reading the comments and people saying things about Indochine's realism. From what I can understand from my family (who are all half-French, half-Vietnamese, and who left Vietnam pretty much at the time the film wraps up), the sense you get of Eliane ""being in charge"" of the Vietnamese, and the failure to look at things from the viewpoint of the Vietnamese themselves, but only from the French perspective, is pretty accurate. Society was essentially segregated in Saigon / Indochina. One member of my family told me a story about how they left the French ""compound"" in Saigon one day with their mother and - for the first time - saw the real Vietnamese people, in tattered clothes... Cue ""why are they in rags, mummy?"" ""because that's the way most people live."" So, as I see it at least, I wouldn't criticise this film for the sense you get of the French being oblivious to the reality of their existence in Indochina. That's the way it was. That's the way most colonies were, in fact (think Shanghai). And I think that's the masterstroke of this film: that people lived their lives without ever thinking about the broader impact of what was going on, until everything just fell to pieces around their ears.",4
Kachindo,"There is some difference of opinion about whether this is a good film or not. Some have called it a ""soap opera"" beautifully filmed. (Both Leonard Maltin in his Movie and Video Guide and the good people at Video Hound used that designation.) But I don't think that is correct at all. Beautifully filmed yes, stunning at times like something from David Lean; and in fact this film has more in common with the Hollywood panoramic epic than it does with the tradition of the French cinema. But it is certainly not a soap opera. In a soap opera the important element is a narrow focus on things material, social, and sexual played out in a banal, clich-ridden and bourgeois manner. In Indochine the focus is on political change and why it came about.The story begins in Vietnam in 1930 and concludes on the eve of the communist revolution in 1954--presaging the tragic American involvement a decade later. Catherine Deneuve plays Eliane Devries, the strong-willed owner of a rubber plantation in Vietnam, then part of the French colonial empire. Having no children of her own (or a husband) she raises the Vietnamese girl Camille (Linh Dan Pham) as her own. She conducts secret affairs (and even visits opium dens) while maintaining the appearance of respectability. We are shown the decadence of the French living in Vietnam and the exploitive evils of colonialism, hardy the stuff of soap opera. We are made aware of the social unrest stirring amongst the population and even shown what amounts to a slave auction conducted by the colonial powers with the aid of the French military, in particular, the French navy.Enter Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a handsome French naval officer who, despite the difference in their ages, initiates an affair with Eliane. She is at first put off, then reluctant, and then madly in love. Perhaps this familiar progression is what some think of as soap opera material; and perhaps it is, although their affair is only a small part of the film, and at any rate, such behavior is entirely consistent with Eliane's character and that of Jean-Baptiste, and is necessary for the plot developments to come.Deneuve was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy but didn't win (Emma Thompson won for Howard's End), but the film itself won as Best Foreign Film. In truth Deneuve's performance is a little uneven. Regardless, this is one of the most important roles in the career of an actress who was as beautiful in 1991 when this film was made as she had been in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) at the beginning of her career. Indeed, I would say even more beautiful. My favorite Deneuve film, by the way, is Mississippi Mermaid (1969) with Jean-Paul Belmondo directed by Francois Truffaut.Also uneven is the direction by Regis Wargnier. The scenes set in Saigon involving the French and the Mandarins at their pleasures amid their wealth as they maintain their privilege are done with strikingly beautiful interiors splashed with the kind of color seen in, for example, the films of Chinese director Zhang Yimou. The scenes amount to indictments of the French and demonstrate why the communists eventually came to power. Note that the privileged are always decked out in the most amazing displays of color while the workers and the peasants are brown and dirty.The panoramic cinematography of the Vietnamese country is also strikingly beautiful. We are shown the sheer cliffs falling into tranquil waters dotted with junks, the rock outcrops nestled in verdant growth, the angry skies, and the deluge of the monsoon. But the trek of Camille across the land to find her beloved is not realistically done. Her quick incorporation in a peasant family is also not convincing. And the following scene in which she and Jean-Baptiste escape from the slave market defies probability. However what becomes of her and him is brutally realistic and consistent with what we know about those times, although I would like to have seen them being fed when they are rescued and some indication of how they spent their time in that Shangri-la-like hidden valley.Despite the flaws and inconsistencies, this is a fine cinematic experience, enthralling, disturbing and visually beautiful. See this as a prelude to all other films about Vietnam and the Vietnam War. What will become clear is how foolish was our involvement and how doomed to failure it had to be.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",5
Kachindo,"OK let's get it out of the way up front, Eliane IS France, Camille IS Vietnam the story is their story. Of course it is told from the French viewpoint, France is telling the story about her child growing up. It is a sad story, the French lost. It was not a happy story for the Vietnamese they had to fight for 2 more years to be reunited and struggle for 15 more to start to come out of the whole process. That said this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, period.The intricate ballet of personal dealings and politics is carried out so well that one can easily get lost in the levels, just as one can get lost in the intricate dance that is life in Asia. What you see is what you see, it may be more or less depending.I do not believe that the movie defends France not does it condemn her. That part of the story is wisely left alone, what remains is a human drama of the folly of resisting the inevitability of change. As the film unfolds the sheer weight of history comes down on all involved.It is that weight that brings the tears. From the time that Jean-Baptiste is brought to Saigon to the closing credits, there is no escape for anyone. The old order is out the new is awaiting its time of entry upon the stage. It is a time for tears, a time to mourn and ultimately a time to heal.Americans in particular have a funny sense of history. We forget that others have been down the same roads before us. France's relationship with vietnam was most likely more of a force in the history of its people than ours with all of our napalm will ever be, because the French left a legacy of life that could be seen even in the senslessness of the American presence.This movie captures that relationship and transcends it. Masterpiece is the lest one can say about such a work.",0
Kachindo,"This is a wonderful very tragic movie about love triangle set against French fall down in Vietnam. I was actually quite surprised at one of the comments, which roughly said that the Vietnamese girl falls in love with French officer for no reason at all. Does not everybody know that love always happens for no reason at all? That is why many famous love stories are tragic, people tend to fall in love with completely wrong people, from different perspectives.I did not seem wrong to me that Elaine was ""mothering"" her Vietnamese workers. Remember ""Gone with the wind""? How Scarlett's mother was treating her slaves, tending to them when they were sick? I believe that many people felt that way towards their slaves/servants/workers. Elaine grew up in Vietnam, she thought about it as her home and Vietnamese as her people, though in a bit simplistic way. What I am trying to say, is that her relationship with Vietnamese in the movie does not look untrue. Perhaps to some people it just looks politically incorrect these days, when most people think that colonization was all that bad. It is too complicated an issue and the movie was not about it. On the contrary, the movie wins while portraying both caring and cruel French people in Indochina, not painting only with black and white colors, rather raising questions, than giving simplistic answers. It is rare in movies these days. This movie is done with impeccable European charm and gets 10/10 from me.I am ready to defend my viewpoint at the Message Boards any time.",5
Kachindo,"If we think about movies that deal with the recent past of Vietnam, then everybody immediately thinks of war movies like for instance, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter... But why is that? I know how important this war was for the Americans as well as for the Vietnamese, but this is an old country with an ancient culture that has a lot more to offer than the battles, bombs and booby traps in the jungle, the rice fields or the cities. ""Indochine"" is a movie that tries to show us another part of the country's history. It deals with the latest years of French colonial times in Vietnam or Indochine as they called it back then.The story starts in the 1930's at one of the largest rubber-tree plantations in Indochine (Vietnam). This plantation is owned by the French colonist Eliane, a proud woman who lives with her father and her native adoptive daughter Camille. She doesn't have a husband or a man in her life (apart from her father), but gets to know the young officer Jean-Baptiste when both want to buy the same painting at an auction. They have a short affair, but than she refuses to see him again. In the meantime it's Camille who has fallen in love with Jean-Baptiste and Eliane knows it. She makes sure he's send to one of the most desolate outposts on some remote island, making sure that the two will never see each other again. Camille has no choice, but to marry the man she was promised to, but in the meantime she starts a search to find the man she really loves.This could have been a romantic movie in a different setting than we are used to, but nevertheless one like we have seen many more before. And in a way it is, but the movie has a lot more to offer as well. It shows the atrocities committed by the French, the great poverty of the indigenous people, the rise of Communism and the futile attempts to stop them (before the French got involved in the war that would later be continued by the Americans). This movie is a lesson in history and geography wrapped in a paper of romance and marvelous landscapes. It was beautiful and dramatic at the same time. I was touched and amazed by it and really liked it a lot. That's why I give this movie at least an 8/10.",4
Kachindo,I first saw this movie as a college project and was just blown away. It has a really decent plot that allows one to enjoy the movie while giving a history lesson and some of the reasons for the war between the French and Vietnamese people. A good see for those who want to see a different kind of movie and a MUST see for anyone interested in the history of the French involvement in Vietnam and the reasons for the intense dislike of the French by the common man in Vietnam. The scenery is outstanding. You will need to be ready to pay attention because the movie is in French and has English Subtitles. I think that this adds to the allure of the movie and did not take away from my enjoyment.,5
Kachindo,"Indochine is a wonderful, poignant film set in the 30's during the French Vietnam conflicts. Catherine Deneuve is the terribly engrossing heroine,Elaine Devries, who uses her wealthy status as a rubber plantation owner to cover up her affairs. However, things get complicated when her adopted daughter falls in love with her much younger lover. This movie shows a wonderful unbiased perspective about Vietnam, and the acting is superb, with Vincent Perez and Dominique Blanc. This is a intricate and complex movie that will leave you thinking long after the movie is finished.",0
Kachindo,"I've seen at least 10-20 post-Vietnam movies, nearly all concentrating on the war or the aftermath of a war in a country that most Americans know absolutely nothing about (including me).What a relief it was to learn something about the years of mistreatment Indo-Chine (or Vietnam) suffered at the hands of the French colonists who seem to have the 'reverse-Midas-touch' when it comes to their land possessions. Then again, I suppose this is the way of all colonists who invariably mistreat their 'possessions'..The acting was terrific by all involved.  Learning the pre-war background behind the extreme North/South polarizations and seeing all the strife that's touched Vietnam was the best lesson I've yet gleaned from any Vietnam movie.I think a cure has finally been developed for Oliver Stone.As high a rating as possible.",0
Kachindo,"A beautiful film about the latter years of the French colonial era in Vietnam. I notice some comments that seem confused about Deneuve's characters attitude toward the Vietnamese on her rubber plantation. They find her ""maternalism"" offensive and therefore? what, they don't like the film? What do they expect from a colonialist? Compare this to Mel Gibson's character in The Patriot, a slave owner who has released all his slaves (1700s) and re-hired them. Is this more believable? More comfortable?The French exploited the natural resources and the population of Vietnam; that's what colonialism was all about, and I don't see that this film is even faintly supportive of colonialism. On the contrary, Indochine offers some clarity about what the Vietnamese were rebelling against, and background for the conflict that would later pull in the US.And a gorgeous, gorgeous movie.",4
Kachindo,"Not many foreign films have caught my eye. A lot of them seem surreal and have hidden messages that you have to try hard to convey. Indochine is different. It is intense and gripping and all the while you never lose sense of the message. The love story intertwined makes it remarkably attractive to females, the adventure makes it great for males, and the epic history of Vietnam makes it a masterpiece to critics and professionals. I thoroughly found this film to excel and it does live up to its praise.",5
Kachindo,"Just watched this movie on VHS on a TV. It was not like seeing it for the first time on a large screen in a theater. Watched it in French without subtitle, because I am bilingual. Probably that is helps to like the movie. The plot is a bit stretched, but the historical perspective is very good. It serves as a good educational tool, to understand the reasons behind the defeat of France and after that the USA. The scenery is just incredible. Deneuve is a great actress and the other actors too including even minor supporting actors. It is not an action pack movie with a rapid pace; but the plot is so interesting, it is never boring.",5
Kachindo,"I first saw this movie in a french class at univ. I don't think it is a film talking about communists or communism,it is more like a brief history of Vietnam under control by France. Every country has its own style and way of developing,so telling a love story can't part from the condition or the atmosphere.It is not a happy-ending love story,I don't know whether ""tragedy"" is a proper word, but it fills with joys and sorrows.I like something with deep meanings and deep feelings or emotions.Indochine is right for me.I am not sure where the film was shot,the scenery is nice and characteristic. The roles are vivid and rich,esp Eliane played by Catherine Deneuve. Although i had to read the English subtitles while listening to french, the film still grabbed my attention tightly.",4
Kachindo,"I got a better understanding of why the Vietnamese people turned to Communism. Hell, With folks like the French as the murdering, raping, occupying force,  who wouldn't rebel. But the film isn't just a social commentary, It's a beautiful albeit tragic love story. I didn't particularly like the ending. I was looking for that reconciliation but then I realized it doesn't always happen that way. See it. The acting is superb, the storyline and cinematography is great and, even if you don't want to, you'll learn something about history.",5
Kachindo,"I was never aware of this film, perhaps because I was not of the appropriate age to appreciate, but I must say, about thirteen years after its theatrical release, I was quite pleased with it on every level. Not only were the locations appropriately beautiful, and the cinematography mature and relaxed, but the acting, casting, plot development, and dialogue were in beautiful harmony. The film was a fantastic lesson in history to which Vietnam and the rest of us are owed. To satisfy length requirements for my comments, I will add, that this crew did not shy away from showing characters who experience anger, insult, jealousy, pain and all the rest with true precision. It is nice to see fine acting and depth with appropriate casting. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see color and who can read subtitles. I would also recommend that this film be viewed in two or three sittings. I did this because of disruptions, but actually, this respite added to the inherent suspense of each characters' fate and made the film easier to digest on a whole. Nonetheless, you will find, that the film flows and throws in excitement just where it is needed.",4
Kachindo,"(SPOILERS) Regis Wargnier's Indochine is superb. The premise is simple enough: Eliane, a wealthy French landowner has an adopted Vietnamese daughter during French Indochina. Her life revolves her adored daughter and her extensive rubber plantation. Ultimately, they separate.But what's complex is the relationship between Eliane and the people she controls (her workers, her child) which underlines the fraught relationship an empire has with her colonies. Eliane symbolizes the French empire while Camille symbolizes Indochina (which ultimately broke free from France). Eliane is both paternalistic and maternal, both cruel and kind at the same time, a privilege the empires have on their colonies. She protects a little boy, she whips a male worker for an offense - all this regarded by her as something maternal: a parent's love towards her child. She adores her plantation and runs it effectively and proudly.At the same time, she passionately loves Camille who is very close to her; too passionately perhaps to the point of being controlling like she is with everything in her life. She tells Camille that there is no difference between races, that she (Eliane) is in fact Asian (as she was born in Indochina and has lived all her life there). But this is far from the truth. There is in fact an unequal relationship, of which Eliane enjoys the better end of the stick. The passionate tango which the mother and daughter performs at their Christmas party shows this. At first glance the dance is innocent. However, we see that Eliane whispers to Camille that she wants to be alone with her in a mountain chalet ""like in the fairy tales"". This parodies a heterosexual courting relationship and illustrates Eliane's masculinity (equated with the need to dominate) - not surprising as Eliane is thrust into the role of command usually linked to men and therefore enjoy the privileges accorded to men. This also illustrates the fact that despite their bond, there's no doubt that Eliane is linked to European privilege and that Camille is pampered, adored and doesn't stray far - France's exotic little pet.But ultimately Indochina decides she no longer wants to be a pet. The turning point of the mother-daughter relationship starts when young and handsome Jean-Baptiste, a naval officer, enters the picture. Eliane's and Camille's tranquil life together is rocked. Eliane's usual cold and distant (and not to mention, secretive) approach to relationships is shattered when she actually falls for hims; the situation is made impossible when her daughter Camille also falls for Jean-Baptiste after being ""saved"" by him at a shooting. Jealous and hurt, Eliane orders him to be posted to the remote Con Dao islands. However, she underestimates Camille's will. Love-struck, Camille sets out cross country to go to Jean-Baptiste. Eliane and Camille's relationship as they knew it is never the same again.Indochine is a superb picture illustrating a mother's love and control towards her child, and how the dependent child must ultimately separate, a metaphor of the fact that all empires end.Make no mistake that this is France's story of the empire she lost; in fact from the very start of the movie, we hear Eliane narrating the story. Even when Camille was running away through the countryside, it is through Eliane's lens that we see the voyage. We don't see her Communist training. The details are unknown to Eliane. Eliane is simply imposing her emotions and narration on what happened, just like an empire imposes and creates the stories of her colonies.The story is told with a charismatic soundtrack and cinematography. The shots of the Vietnamese countryside and the famous Ha Long Bay simply take your breath away, alongside with the shots of the rubber plantation misty in the morning. Eliane's wardrobe is also a feast for the eyes.Excellent performances from Catherine Deneuve and Linh Dam Pham, whose portrayal of their characters' outward restraint and control also successfully show us their turmoil and pain. Deneuve was truly deserving of her Oscar nomination and Cesar win (alongside with the Golden Globe). Indochine has become one of her celebrated latter-day works, and rightly so.However, one point off for the movie taking too long to unfurl; there is a sub-plot involving Yvette, the wife of Eliane's French coolie, that I did not care to know about. But over-all, a superb film, greatly nostalgic, which at the end may leave you with a heavy, melancholic feeling.",5
Kachindo,"This film was made with such breathtaking care that I don't expect to see another film that will move me with such intensity. The story line is told with painstaking detail in Vietnam against the back drop of war, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye ""oh that's too bad,"" but sobbing ""OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!"" Catherine's character and the Vietnam girl play it to perfection.I remember a comment kept running through my head, ""this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault."" This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this",5
Kachindo,"If you are looking for a complete and touching story of Vietnam under colonialism, this would be one of the better films to watch. I found the setting and the portrayal of Viet Nam to be very thought-provoking and historical, and I felt that the roles that the characters played were compelling. The human story is very complete in its' portrayal, at the end leaving you fulfilled with the time that you have invested. It is quite thought-provoking and emotional, from start to finish.The evolution of the film and the growth of its' characters left nothing to be desired, and it was definitely well-executed with a historical, haunting background.",4
Kachindo,"I saw this movie first when I was only 14 and I fell in love with it. It has a wonderful storyline and it keeps you involved from beginning to end. The cast is magnificent, each playing their character with amazing believability and accuracy. Besides being educational (for those of us who are or were unversed in the history of the rubber industry in Indo-China, as I was), it also has stunning cinematography. There are plenty of pan and aerial shots to keep you amazed throughout the movie. The only disadvantage for some viewers may be that it is French with English subtitles. But if you decide to rent this movie, I highly doubt you will be disappointed, it's a definite 10 out of 10.",5
Kachindo,One of the ten greatest films of the last 25 years. I could watch it again and again for the nuances and the scenery and the recreation of an age and a place. Right up there with the best! DeNeuve deserved the Oscar she didn't get.,0
Kachindo,"Some of the INDOCHINE comments already posted are so powerful that I was hesitant to offer my own. I am not an authority on the art of cinema, preferring to experience films and then see what I think/feel about them. INDOCHINE is a profoundly beautiful and moving film. I watch it now and then to recalibrate my moral compass.Background: I believe that colonialism's fate was sealed with the invention of movable type. Granted, it seemed unstoppable for a few centuries, but all forms of Manifest Destiny, et. al, like all dogs, eventually have their day. So will those that are currently wallowing in ""puerile, self-congratulatory nationalism,"" to borrow a phrase from Carl Sagan. Philosophically speaking, colonialism, like slavery, is indefensible. What's to like, unless you're the one doing it? True, there are films that celebrate the triumph of colonial powers over lesser beings. Here are three: THE FOUR FEATHERS, THE SAND PEBBLES, sort of, and GUNGA DIN, also sort of. GUNGA DIN, however, imputes more intelligence to the erudite Thugee leader, GURU, than the three loutish British noncoms who fight him to preserve the RAJ. The noble, water-carrying Gunga Din, a sort of human reincarnation of Rin-Tin-Tin, saves the day and gives his life for his beloved leaders. More than often, such films serve patriotic purposes. Whatever works, eh?INDOCHINE is a fine example of cinematic art with a strong message about social justice and the rights, under Natural Law, of all peoples. It is strikingly beautiful. But under all this beauty lay injustice, cruel exploitation and addiction to drugs and sexual appetites. One sees the rot and decay of the French and Mandarin ruling classes. Compared to them, the Communists didn't look half bad. For more on that subject, look up THE NEW CLASS, by Milovan Djilas, in Wikopedia if you don't want to read it.Just as France held fast to her colonies in Indochina like a parasite, colonist/rubber plantation owner Emile fastened on to his daughter, Elaine. In turn, she clung to her beautiful adopted daughter, Camille. The most striking metaphor was the Tango scene, in which mother and daughter danced a grotesque parody of romance. The young naval officer, Jean Baptiste, saw this very clearly. Confronting Elaine with this awful truth got him banished, his naval career in tatters (actually, it's not quite that simple). It also put in motion a tragic set of events that convulsed the lives of all concerned. The love between Camille and Jean Baptiste survived, living on through their infant son, Etienne, who was adopted and raised by Elaine. Every time I watch this remarkable film I feel emotionally drained. Time to watch something light and funny, eh?",0
Kachindo,"""Indochine"" is epic film-making of a kind rarely practiced any longer. To me, it brought to mind ""Gone With The Wind"" and the films of David Lean, but I enjoyed it far more. The film's cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning - never forced or pretty for their own sake, but appropriate and executed with consummate craftsmanship. ""Indochine"" tells of the demise of French colonialism in what became Vietnam in an even-handed manner, never placing all virtue on any one side, but narrating its story through characters who are dimensional, flawed, and recognizably human; in only one case is there a character who is completely unsympathetic, and that is a bit part. It is never easy to create characters who exhibit reprehensible qualities but still keep the audience interested in and sympathetic to them; ""Indochine"" accomplishes this adroitly. The issues of France's colonial interest in Indochina come across in a natural, nuanced way through the actions of the large and varied cast, without it ever seeming like we're getting a history lesson. Catherine Deneuve's reputation as a somewhat chilly actress is used to good effect here, which is not to suggest that her performance is at all one-note. Of interest is the depiction of the relationship between the French, and the natives who are essentially subjugated and exploited; however, there is real affection, at times, between members of the two groups, until the forces of history take over. The story of ""Indochine"" has many parallels throughout history - the story of a European (or American) interest moving in on the resources of an undeveloped country and appropriating them for its own profit and to the detriment of the inhabitants of the region. Somehow it took me fifteen years to get around to seeing this film, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. The film exceeded my expectations, and I recommend it to anyone interested in intelligent, yet still entertaining, film-making.",0
Kachindo,"A brilliant movie. I liked it very very much - great story, well-told, wonderful cast. There is everything in this story - atmosphere,love, pain, forgiveness. And Catherine Deneuve is a terrific choice - she is GREAT.",5
Kachindo,"I can understand Americans' harsh criticism of this film. This movie is far from Hollywood blockbusters that wash their brains. This is a masterpiece. Who called the play of Deneuve uneven? Actually, she lost the Academy Award to Thompson just because they do not like French actresses in the Academy. Let's recall Adjani in Camille Clodelle. Another masterpiece that lost Oscar to Anglo Saxon actress. Deneuve's performance is not only the Award winning performance, it is a cosmic, universal achievement of humanity. And there are no enough expressions and words to describe the magic of this movie. Let's do not get into the details of historical inconsistencies found by some paranoic personalities. Let's watch the movie through the eyes of French and Vietnamese people and not through the judgemental eyes of some always reprimanding complaners.",5
Kachindo,"... and there's a lot of that about because Vietnam WAS Indochina at the time this movie deals with which is primarily the 1930s. Eliane Devries (Catherine Deneuve) has both a daughter and a son yet has never given birth which is maybe a metaphor for France 'adopting' Indochina. Like Heart Of Darkness the film employs a frame-narrator in the shape of Deneuve who begins by telling her story to Camille (Linh Dan Pham) whose parents have just been killed and because they were Eliane's best friends she has adopted Camille - who comes with a dowry of her parent's land which swell the size of Eliane's rubber plantation - and both raises and loves her as her own. Devries is a chic Frenchwoman who, for reasons never satisfactorily explained, has forsaken the chic, culture and civilisation of France for a superficially beautiful yet ultimately harsh land that's not unlike the ante-bellum South without the Mississippi. When a young naval officer, Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) appears on the scene the inevitable happens and May and December have their mayfly moment. Jean-Baptiste was, of course, the name of the mime artist in Les Enfants du Paradis and is well chosen given that Perez, who has all the charisma of the Black Hole of Calcutta on a bad day, might just as well be miming for all the animation he brings to his lines. Equally inevitably Camille falls in love with him and when Deneuve has him transferred to a remote outpost Camille follows him and contrives to kill one of his colleagues putting them both on the run. All this is played out against the political unrest that is always a by-product of colonialism. In turn Camille has a child by Jean-Baptiste; he is killed, she becomes something of a Vietnamese La Passionara and Deneuve winds up holding the baby and it is he, now a grown man, to whom Deneuve is narrating the story in 1954 as Indochina became Vietnam. Weighing in at two and a half hours it requires stamina but in addition to Deneuve both Jean Yanne and Dominique Blanc are on hand and against all the odds it does keep you watching.",4
Badla,"When you watch a remake of an outstanding movie with some mind-blowing twist in the end and some amazing cinematography and acting, you already have your expectations at the next level. To be really fair, I was awestruck after watching ""An invisible guest"" and the effect it left after, but I still watched Badla with a neutral mind and gave it a genuine try. But at the end, I felt I just saw a translated version of it's original. It's a screen by screen copy paste along with 90 percent of the dialogues. The only change was the gender. Come on Ghosh ji, use some of your creativity. Why would you just remake the movie exactly the same. Remake doesn't mean copy paste. For instance, look at Don. That's a fab remake, it not only gave justice to it's predecessor but also took it to a different level. For those of you who liked Badla, just watch it's original and you will understand my super disappointment.",2
Badla,"#BadlaReview
Sujoy Ghosh continuously failed to meet the expectations that he had created with Kahaani!
But the expectations of his comeback were always high. Trailer made Badla look like that comeback movie.
And yes, indeed it is that movie.The whole cast's performances were very realistic and top class.In this revenge Drama, not even a single character is set till the end. Every now and then you keep wondering who is protagonist and who is antagonist.Oh, forgot to mention. There are some references to Mahabharata as well. Also, if you pay attention, below lines become very powerful.
Me 6 dekhu jo tum mjhe dikha rhi ho ya isme chhipa hua 9 dekhu.Answers lies in the details.So we all know that it's a revenge story (Title gives that away). But who is taking revenge? Is this revenge of only one person?What I liked: Direction, acting of the entire cast especially Amitabh, Tapsee and Amrita, production value, screenplay, suspense.What I didn't like: All the characters are shown very intelligent. I can accept that. But sometimes they do silly mistakes, which is not acceptable on seeing their intelligence.Overall: There is not even a single frame that will bore you. Its one of the rare Bollywood movie which keep you engaged from the word GO.
Badla is not one of its kind movie but its one of the best of its kind. Have you watched Kahaani, Drishyam or Andhdhun? Then you must watch #Badla.",5
Badla,Same script...Same Dialogue.. No creativity just money making film.. suggest to watch original movie invisible guest...It's on netflix..Dont waste money for duplicate,1
Badla,"A great mystery/thriller movie is the one where you guess something and it turns out to be wrong. This is that kind of movie. Acting is average from the supporting cast but the lead cast steals the show.It's good to see Indian movies exploring different Genres. Even though it is a rip off of a foreign movie, you'll enjoy it if you haven't seen the original, like me...",4
Badla,"At the time of watching this movie, no can judge who is killer, this is all time best thriller pack of Bollywood i ever seen, must watch movie...
10/10 ratings,
Acting also superb by all
Specially all favorite Amitabh ji...",5
Badla,"Simply outstanding.
Without wasting time who are reading my review please do watch this mouth watering suspense mystery..2hours of pure class acting by whole cast..
Please go for it.",5
Badla,"If you think that this is a sequel to the PINK with a social cause and court room drama then you are mistaken . This is a thriller mystery film with suspense and chill . Shot in UK the story starts very slowly with conversation and narratives ...And picks up the speed with revelation and punches ... And picks up the great work of spellbound tight script and leaves you bemused
Everybody is a class in itself",4
Badla,"Although it's a remake of ""The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) (2017) "" Directed by my personal favorite""Oriol Paulo"",sujoy ghosh with full awesomeness adapted and improvised the story. Amitabh bachchan,tapsee pannu as ovious did thier part awesomly. Tooth gripping, breath taking, forcing you to be on edge of your seats this movie will blow your mind away just like a shotgun fired on a point blank range",5
Badla,Excellent film brilliant performance from the cast enjoyed it from start to finish best film of 2019,5
Badla,"Badla is definitely an engrossing movie for viewers who have not seen the original. Badla is a scene by scene remake of the Spanish thriller ""The Invisible Guest"". The only difference is the protagonists are flipped. Having said that the movie still delivers and keeps the audience guessing.The positives of the movie are good acting by Amitabh Bachchan who keeps the spectators guessing with his screen presence and Amrita Singh as a suffering mother. Top notch cinematography and thankfully no songs. The movie moves with a good pace which is an essential requirement of a thriller.Sujoy Ghosh adapted screenplay and direction is good. Ghosh has done a fair job compared to other filmmakers who are blindly copying stories and remaking.Badla's weakest link is the main lead Tapsee Pannu who is not convincing in her act as a shrewd business woman. Rest of the characters also are not in finesse compared to the original movie.Though the original is a classic masterpiece and by no means I am comparing. Overall, a good watch for the audience who do not watch International cinema.
The bottom line is Bollywood movie makers need to be smart as Indian audience now have access to the International Cinema and they need to focus on original stories rather merely adapting from around the world.",4
Badla,Best movie of 2019 everyone should watch story and acting is the backbone of the movie,5
Badla,"Its an amazing movie, 1 star less just cuz its a remake. Both characters r well written n shud i talk abt acting skills of AB.. NAA... Let his records speak fr him.",5
Badla,Badla is one of the best thriller I have seen in recent times! Edge to seat suspance till the end. Amitji was terrific and tapsee as usual doing great job!,5
Badla,"First let me give credits to the original movie The Invisible Guest (2016). Awesome remake.
This movie keeps you hooked to the screen till the last second. Brilliant thriller and fantastic performances by every character.",5
Badla,"BADLA REVIEW :-Sujoy Ghosh was the name to look forward since he delivered Classic thriller Kahani. He went quite low with other films but the Expectations of his Comeback were always carried. Badla was looking like that Comeback Film from the Trailer, and the Cast made it look sure shot winner. Now the Final Product is out and it is nothing less that whatever promised. Sujoy Ghosh is Back with another Fine Thriller which should not be missed.Badla is a Revenge Drama where Characters aren't set till the end, you keep getting shocks on alternate occassions asking yourself that who is Protagonist and who is Antagonist? Taapsee Pannu is showcased as Protagonist but is she really that? Amitabh Bachchan plays a Neutral Lawyer throughout the film untill the Brilliant Climax blows you away. Amrita Singh is a Pleasant Surprise as she plays one of the Most Important Role in this Maze. All of them Act with thier souls to make the Chatacters very much audience friendly. Background Music is Top Notch, it gives you that feel of Anger, Scare, Thrill etc. Writing is Perfect, and it was Expected due to Remake thing. Sujoy Ghosh as Director does an Excellent Job, he manages to keep you hooked till the End and forces you to Clap on the Very Last scene. The screenplay in the First half is Ordinary and it could have been much better compared to overall impact of the Film therefore this remains the only let down here.As a Whole, Badla is one of the Finest Thriller made in Bollywood with Magic of Illusional Truth. You keep asking for turnaround moments and Film responds quickly to your requests. The Mahabharata Characters reference works on upper side, generating little bit more Interest. This one is a Sujoy Ghosh Trademark film and should not be missed if you like Quality Films, especially in Thriller Genre. This one would have been a Classic if the First half supported enough. Comparatively, it does not surpass Kahaani but fortunately goes very close to that level, nevertheless Badla is still a Must Watch.RATING - 7/10*",4
Badla,Excellent movie badla Amitabh Bachchan different rule Taapsee Pannu excellent acting badla movie full package suspense movie Shahrukh Khan production red chilli entertainment excellent badla movie 9 star/red chilli entertainment 9 star/Amitabh Bachchan sir 9 star/Taapsee Pannu 9 star/all time blockbuster,5
Badla,"Badla Movie Is Thriller Suspense Story , New Story Loved It Every minute Of Film Is Full Of Suspense Amazing Crime Thriller.",5
Badla,No nonsense only script with two brilliant actors!,5
Badla,"Badla : The film is a remake of hit Spanish thriller The Invisible Guest (2016)Badla starts off with Amitabh Bachchan's character Badal Gupta prepping for his case to save Naina Sethi from the murder charge. What starts then is an interesting, engaging, intriguing and tense ride.Naina Sethi (Taapsee Pannu) is accused of murdering her lover Arjun Joseph (Tony Luke). With everything going against her, she hires a lawyer, Badal Gupta (Amitabh Bachchan), who, in his 40 years of career, has never lost a case. The movie then follows the lawyer's investigation to find the truth amidst a web of lies.
Amitabh Bachchan is at the top of his game.Amrita Singh, for me, was the highlight of the film. I would specifically like to mention one scene when she meets Taapsee at a party, her performance in that particular scene will choke you.Taapsee Pannu is a complete natural.There are no songs in the film, which is a good thing as none was required. The background score is good and supports the movie well.The background score is good, the cinematography is beautiful and the editing is sharp. Dialogues are good and there is a tinge of humour in it, especially those spoken by Amitabh Bachchan's character.Badla keeps public at the edge of the seats which means Sujoy Ghosh has done a fab job.",4
Badla,Wah kya movie tha maja aa gaya. best movie of 2019...,5
Badla,"I had read reports that suggested that the movie is a 'copy' of the Spanish film 'Contratiempo' (The Invisible Guest), but since the movie credits both, the original film and Oriol Paulo (original screenplay), it's safe to say that it's a 'remake' and shouldn't be confused with an act of plagiarism.Sujoy Ghosh's 'Kahaani' had proved to be one of the most spectacular crime-thrillers of recent times; when I walked in to watch Badla, I hoped to watch a flick that harbored similar levels of intensity, intelligence and realness. The film might not have entirely fulfilled that desire, but it didn't stand really far either.The title of the film gives away the focal point of the plot - revenge, but who's revenge is the story about? Naturally, this is the question that the viewer, right since the beginning, tries to answer. As we familiarize ourselves with the plot, the makers try to bewilder us and discard our predictions with alternate hints; unfortunately, they don't succeed comprehensively. Another element that thwarts the story's realness lies in the characters - all the major characters are overly intelligent, while this is still acceptable, what makes it worse is that they somehow forgo their intelligence during specific parts of the plot, which is of utmost convenience for the storyteller, but not much for the viewer. The film certainly capitalizes in taking us aback with the use of what Amitabh Bachchan's character refers to as ""details"". It also convincingly manages to fool us into misjudging the motives that bolster the characters' actions, this, for me, was the most impressive factor. The mystery-revealing climax was partly predictable; it does raise a major plot-oriented question, but sadly I can't possibly point it out in a spoiler-free review.The star cast is decent, with Amitabh Bachchan serving as the cream of the crop. Amrita Singh and Taapsee Pannu were successful in portraying their characters appreciably. The performances of Tanveer Ghani and Tony Luke were fair, although certain parts wete mediocrely put forth. Manav Kaul pulled of an average performance as well. Sujoy Ghosh's adapted screenplay and direction deserves a special mention, and plays a role in making the viewers overlook the loopholes. Other departments too managed to bring to light a satisfactory performance.",4
Badla,"This movie is very nice.. Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee both are superb acting..
BLOCKBUSTER movie
I think you should also watch movie...",5
Badla,"The most basic ingredient for a good movie, is a good story. Add to that Amitabh and Tapsee cast in good roles and delivering the best acting. And you have an edge of the seat thriller. Hard to find fault with this movie, and I looked hard....they only thing, maybe, was the very last part of the end maybe over the top...except the, really worth a watch!! 10/10",5
Junglee,"--------
Raj Nayar (Vidyut Jammwal), a veterinary doctor from Mumbai, visits his father after a long gap of ten years in their Chandrika elephant sanctuary (Odisha). Soon after, a ghastly attack on the elephants by a bunch of poachers, led by (Atul Kulkarni), changes his life forever.Initially lured by the city life, Raj now decides to protect the gentle giants in the sanctuary, which has always been his father's dream. After a series of unfortunate events that happen in the reserve, Meera (debutante Asha Bhat), a journalist from Mumbai and Shankara (debutante Pooja Sawant), a mahout based in the sanctuary, also join Raj's mission of punishing the illegal hunters, who kill elephants for ivory.Protect animals, save the elephants is the primary message that Junglee sends across and it does so in an action-packed way. The film also reiterates that if we pledge to stop buying ivory products, it will prevent poachers from indulging in this illegal trade. True to its theme, the film transports you to the calm of a jungle, away from your city, cell phones and chaos (shot in the beautiful locales of an elephant reserve in Thailand).Known for Hollywood blockbusters like The Mask, The Scorpion King and Eraser, American director Chuck Russell makes his Hindi cinema debut with this one. His fascination for mythology, Hindu mantras, our martial arts like Kalaripayattu and Lord Ganpati is evident, given the Indian essence and exoticism he brings to the story.While the film scores higher on action than emotion, Russell's attempt at blending the two with a social cause, stands out for a variety of reasons.All the actors exude effortless comfort around the elephants, which is rare for an Indian film that revolves around animals. The last Indian film that captured the man-elephant camaraderie was Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), starring Rajesh Khanna.The film's highlight, other than its fight against poachers who kill elephants for tusks, is Vidyut Jammwal's brilliance as one of our finest action heroes. His action is absolutely flawless and perhaps the best in the business. The jaw-dropping, lethal action scenes he portrays on screen and his mastery in martial arts puts him at par with the finest action heroes across the globe.Action sequences that holds your attention and makes this film a paisa vasool entertainer, that is bound to attract families and children.Such an adventurous and brave attempt is rare in Hindi cinema.",4

And ivory smuggling.
Best Movie for Nature Lovers,Animals Lovers.
Some of the scenes are very adorable and beautiful.
This Movie is mainly dedicated to Natures,Animal,wild life,Indian martial arts(kalaripayattu).
Indian Martial Art (kalaripayattu) is the oldest martial arts and the origin of Kungfu.",5
Junglee,"JUNGLEE REVIEW :There are multiple films made on the same story of jungle where Human's hunger for money destroys forrest world. The Animal comes in mind in that story is most probably an Elephant who is more profitable for hunters. It's been almost 30 years we haven't seen a film on the same old story and here comes Junglee loaded with New Action Mania. The same old story does feel predictable but the action sequences and new set of storytelling makes it a decent watch.Juglee is the same predictable story revolving around Eliphant hunting, and later turning into a Revenge drama. Vidyut Jammwal, Pooja Sawant, Asha Bhat, Atul Kulkarni, Makarand Deshpande and rest of the cast members plays thier roles fine on screen. A Writer should have tried to write something new so that film would have looked more interesting. Screenplay is Tight and that's why film never looks dull or boring. Action and stunts are eye pleasing and the Camera Work is well supporting. Chuck Russell as Director fails to bring some special product, but thank god he doesn't deliver a crap.If you real feel for the animals then Junglee will hit your chords very well, apart from that it is still a very entertaining cinematic experience. But if you are looking for something more than a Decent product then wait, keep those expectations well in limit. The emotional touch of Animals may tug little rings in your heart and the Action mania towards the End works on high note. Overall, Junglee is a Good One Time Watch or rather a decent watch for all kind of Audiences, no matter what your taste is, no matter what your age is.RATING- 5/10*",3
Junglee,"It's a must watch movie for Martial arts and nature lovers, the movie not only entertains you with it's action but also has beautiful locations good acting good music and a message as well",5
Junglee,Guys just don't listen to the critics.They r misleading u.If u want to have some fun with your kids and family then there can't be a better way than junglee.Go for a 2 hour greenish relief..,5
Junglee,"The daring Vidyut Jamwal rocks.......This movie was something we haven't seen before in Bollywood......Awesome cinematography, actions and effects.....This is worth spending money......",5
Junglee,"I love this movie.
Nice story, well framed in Jungle and Indian cultural environment.
Best in showing action
Best in explaining family values.
Best in showing love for family and animals around us.
This is one of the best Bollywood movie in recent times.",5
Junglee,Se who are saying that it is a 'tyg' rip off are seriously dumb bcause movie script have no similarity with 'tyg' . its good entertainer .,5
Junglee,"After seen ' Junglee', I admit that Bollywood movie never reached at standard of Hollywood movie, even it directed by Hollywood director. Chuck Russell tried his best but he doesn't succeed to overcome from Bollywood saga. Yes, ' Junglee' is a typical Bollywood movie by Hollywood director Chuck Russel. There is nothing new in story. Movie is only watchable for Elephants and electrified action from Vidyut Jamawal. I thought that the movie would be same as 'The Protector' starring Tony Jaa, but it is far different. As me it could be made remake of it and could be better. Thanks to director / music director that there are no lazy boring love songs here. Acting by Vidyut is ok, but action is super. Leading lady is only for fill the gap of leading female. Atul Kulkarni is perfect but at last he looses his tempo and looks helpless. Vidyut's father is totally miscast. For such a martial artist son, father should be strong and impressive. Another miscast is Makrand Deshpande, the teacher should have perfect and believable. Direction neither is just okaying, not memorable nor twists side. As suggested by me just watch for elephants (especially for kids in their summer vacation) and Vidyut Jamawal's action. One more plus point is that the camerawork. It is excellent to catch the beauty of natures like mountains, woods, and lakes and of course about elephants too!
A rare movie from Bollywood on elephants after ' Haathi Mere Saathi', Main aur mera Hathi and 'Sufed Hathi'. Good try...and best message that ' Love animals and love natures'.!!!",4

His fascination for mythology, Hindu mantras, our martial arts like Kalaripayattu and Lord Ganpati is evident, given the Indian essence and exoticism he brings to the story, from a Westerner's perspective.While the film scores higher on action than emotion, Russell's attempt at blending the two with a social cause, stands out for a variety of reasons. Along with cinematographer Mark Irwin (known for RoboCop 2), the director manages to capture the enormous animals in their natural habitat. Thankfully, there is no cutesy, orchestrated acting that the elephants are made to do, and they are a sight to behold. All the actors exude effortless comfort around the elephants, which is rare for an Indian film that revolves around animals. The last Indian film that captured the man-elephant camaraderie was Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), starring Rajesh Khanna and Tanuja.The film's highlight, other than its fight against poachers who kill elephants for tusks, is Vidyut Jammwal's brilliance as one of our finest action heroes. His action (without the help of a body double) is absolutely flawless and perhaps the best in the business. The jaw-dropping, lethal action scenes he portrays on screen and his mastery in martial arts puts him at par with the finest action heroes across the globe. A police station scene in particular, where a handcuffed Vidyut single-handedly dodges the cops, is spectacular. You see him fling himself on running vehicles, indulging in fist fights, and sliding through a tiny window and more. It's Chung Chi Li (who has worked with Jackie Chan in the Rush Hour franchise, and movies like Shanghai Noon and The Tuxedo, among others) and Parvez Shaikh's pulsating action that holds your attention and makes this film a paisa vasool entertainer, that is bound to attract families and children.Though Asha and Pooja, in their small parts, make confident and decent debuts. Atul makes his presence felt as the antagonist, who looks at killing mighty animals as a challenge. Understated and genuine, Akshay Oberoi and Makarand Deshpande are impressive in their parts, too.
Watch Junglee for its spellbinding action, cute elephants and gorgeous jungles. Such an adventurous and brave attempt is rare in Hindi cinema.",4
Junglee,A great entertainment. Vidyut Jamwal was a treat to watch.,5
Junglee,"Vidyut Jammwal flexes his muscles and does a bunch of entertaining stunts at the start and the end of Junglee (Wild), a crime drama with a social message about animal (tuskers) and nature conservation that is extremely similar to most films and documentaries about animal and nature conservation. TN.",2
Junglee,"For those who doesn't feel its a good movie then watch cartoon films in ur home, some other review that its have bad action choreography, dude open your eyes its not double stunt action sequences. He did all in real, even Tiger shroff need double stunt. Don't try to watch only item songs, watch the quality of actors...I voted 10/10 for vidyut and his team, his stunt and action, its really awesome. And I want to watch hiis movies in bollywood.",5
Junglee,"It was like ok it was not the best but it was ok
i got little bored by watching it
otherwise it is fine",3
Junglee,"Don't be fool by other 3 review. I don't think they watch this movie. It's one of the worst movie of this month. No story. Director not sure what he is doing. Not entertaining at all. I wanted to getting out from hall in middle. But I didn't just because the seat of the hall was too comfy. Don't waste your money here. If you want entertainment then watch ""kesari"". If you want good story and making watch ""Badla"".",1
Junglee,"They are all associated with the movie. This is the worst directed movie I have seen - almost childish. We saw people leaving in the middle, but I decided to just sleep through. I wonder why would they waste so much money on locations, camera work and not worry about story, dialogs, direction or even editing??",1
Junglee,Just a fight without emotional purpose and weak opponent makes it pointless. And story is very paper thin,2
Junglee,Copying other movies. and have some very bad agenda. Vidyut is promoting those agendas because he belong to Hindu Nationalist family. Also poorly choreographed action scenes makes the movie worst. Specially bike scene and showing totally impossible mad scenes makes it more than worst.,1
Gully Boy,Was never a fan of rap or ranveer singh but this film has totally floored me. On the surface it seems like a rags to riches story but it's so much more. Truly poetry on celluloid. Ranveer does a Bhachan esk performance. It's all I'm his eyes. Just masterful acting cannot believe this is the same guy who played Khilji? ??,5
Gully Boy,"NO ITS NOT COPIED FROM 8 MILE. Did you guys watch 8 mile and Gully Boy both?if you do think they are the same, then you need learn how to watch movies before you compare them. You also need to understand what a movie genre means. May be search in google to get better understanding.you all are saying 8 mile and Gully Boy are the same based on just few things as both movies are about rappers and their struggles. its like calling all the love stories are same because there is a boy and a girl in the movie.From the above rating you can see I liked Gully Boy, music and performances are very good. rapping looks natural. Alia Bhatt is a fire cracker in the movie. I just wish there is lot more to the story. its a worth a watch. Please dont listen to anyone who says its copied from 8 mile, watch both movies to decide for yourself.",4
Gully Boy,"Gully Boy merges into you and makes you feel as a part of Murad's journey (Ranveer Singh).
Dharavi 17 is where he stays and his daily struggles,his exposure to rap, his love life, a mistake in relationship,his guide,his well-wisher,his bonding with parents..
A common man's journey actually.
We all have such stories in our life.
Zoya has brilliantly captured the gully life here and shows how it moulds oneself with the amount of time you spend with people around you.With every movie this guy gets better.So once again Ranveer does his one of career's best.
Alia is the show stealer with dialogues that gets the whistle. We have three supporting Vijays here in this movie Vijay Raaz(father),Vijay Maurya(Uncle),Vijay Varma(Friend) and they are spot on.
Amruta Subash(mother) expresses her life's melancholy brilliantly.Kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs a punch and last but not the least
the game changer Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher). He overpowers Ranveer in many scenes.I won't stop if I start mentioning how apt and brilliant is the screenplay here..
Cinematography by Jay Oza and crisp editing by Nitin Baid are felt on the screen as the movie even being slow in pace doesn't be a boring affair in 2 hrs 35 mins.
Zoya has struck a win win here.Finally, what made it more lively was screen time for real life rappers like Emiway Bantaai,Stony Psycho and Dope Daddy from Dopedealicz , Kaambhaari and also a second of Brodha V.Just felt like saying this that how well the hip hop culture has been able to connect with our generation. Emiway Bantaai's one second presence in first half and the crowd erupted like never seen before. Also , his acts in second half are treat to watch. Not to forget Kaam Bhaari is there too.All in all 9/10 from my side.
Go for it folks.
Watch it for a beautiful journey of the guy from streets.",5
Gully Boy,"It's not about only a rap,it's about every person who struggles their own inside.its the story about every struggling person who trapped under the bloody society.who want to fly,who want to go outside,who want do something.its not a rap movie,it's truly a inspirational movie.",5
Gully Boy,"Its an entertaining movie to watch for and is worth watching too..
Mostly the mumbaikers can relate to the movie as the whole movie is based in Dharavi.
Everyone is good with their character and it was great to see Vijay Raaz as always. He is indeed a very good actor.
To the one who don't understands the rap culture, the movie will be quite overrated but trust me its not.
To the one saying the movie is a copy of 8 miles must watch the movie, this is how the story of rapper can be exactly displayed.
And Ranveer was outstanding with his part and ""Apna Time Aayega"" is just outstanding work by Ranveer, If you feel the character then its also an inspiring story..
According to me its definitely worth watching :)
And the one calling Ranveer Singh's character as overacting are the one who don't understand Mumbai's local language",5
Gully Boy,"This is such a beautifully made film. It's very rare that one walks out of a film thinking of the world in a different way. When the film starts to the end, the director(Zoya Akhtar), makes sure the audience is hooked. Dialogue writer Vijay Maurya, also played by Murad(Ranveer's uncle) wrote some amazing dialogues and a script that not only neatly ties on the gully boy himself, but his love interest, relationships with his family, friends, and his inner demons.
Ranveer has slowly become Indian's Daniel Day Lewis. There is no trace of him in Murad. He is sensitive, daring, intense, and quiet. He breaths fire as he sits in his car, and raps his heart and arms out. He is brooding as he sits and writes after he sees his father's second wife come in his home. He doesn't miss a beat. Alia is growing from strength to strength. After, Udta, Dear Zindagi, Raazi, and now Gully Boy, is the latest in her kitty of great performances. A special mention to Siddarth and Vijay Varma for giving us such lovely characters to root for. Also Vijay Raaz as the abusive father. I hated him and that's a testament to how great Raaz is as an artist.
This movie is a must see. Go in and you'll be happy to spend Valentine's Day with Zoya and her team whom have gifted us this extradinary film. Hard Hai Boss!",5
Gully Boy,A story which justifies the hype it created before even releasing. There's alot to the other than just big names. The contribution of Zoya Akhtar's whole team is brilliant and is visible throughout. The film has a gripping narrative. It has a lot of parallel stories which are quite clear due to Zoya's brilliant directing. Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt have delivered great performances which were expected. Siddhant Chaturvedi is also a delight to watch. The authenticity of the film if commendable.,5
Gully Boy,"Must watch direction, screenplay ,acting everything is good in this movie",5
Gully Boy,"Almost every rap star came from hardships and poverty and that is what rap is, poetry of your life with awesome beats so what the hell were these morons expecting, a guy with no issues becoming a rap star - what was copied from 8 mile? i dare you to justify yourselves you stupid morons. Every part of the movie was awesome.",4
Gully Boy,"This is a perfect collage of stories told in the best possible way by zoya akhtar, it is also ranveer singh best acting ever. every frame is a treat.",5
Gully Boy,"The movie is really beautifully directed, the best part of the movie it shows the sad reality of our day to day life but regardless the movie is full of ""Junoon"" haha I forgot this word almost, love the music, love the direction, actually loved everything in the movie, every character is nicely played. Ranveer and Alia acting is deadly, vo kya bolte hai ""hard hai bhai"" :)
I understand this movie could be copy of 8 mile but hey trust me this is very different and can't be compared. In indian cinema it's hard to find a movie with natural acting and nice music and Gully boy is the one. Highly recommended movie!!",5
Gully Boy,"Saw the movie yesterday.. what an amazing and flawless film. I don't think I've truly experienced a film this close to heart. Every charcter, every frame is etched and performed to perfection. Murad, Safeena, Sher, Moeen - they all win your hearts. Brilliant supporting cast Amruta Subhash Vijay Raaz and others. Go watch it and give the movie Box office validation as such world-class film are made in rarity in the mainstream cinema. Gully Boy is an experience with music and Murad at it's core.",5
Gully Boy,"Zoya changes gear with Gully Boy. It's the story of Murad (Ranveer Singh), his aspiration, ambition, his family, his love Safeena (Alia Bhatt), his friendships and the path he takes to fulfil his dream. At the forefront, Gully Boy may seem like a movie about the underground rappers but actually, it is much more than that.The movie is mainly about human relations, connections, emotions and dynamics. There is no filmmaker better than Zoya Akhtar who can portray and handle human complexities in such a brilliant way. Gully Boy will surely be counted amongst her best work.Ranveer and Alia's chemistry is too cute to be true. They are like a house on fire...,Vijay Varma special mention - He is too good...as Moeen,, got a good depth to the character.If the writing of the movie and Zoya's direction is of the highest order, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, debutant Sidhant Chaturvedi and other actors compliment it with fabulous performances.Alia Bhatt, is the scene stealer. Every scene she appears in is a riot. She is endearing, to say the least. This is one of her best performances and her character is a crash course in women empowerment. I am sure everyone's gonna fall in love with her.On the downside though, the pacing takes a dip in the second half.Gully Boy is one of the best movies to come out of Indian cinema in recent times. Watch it for Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt's dazzling performances. And moreover, watch it for the master filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. Hats off to her. This one's a winner.",4
Gully Boy,"Ek number bhot hard bhot hard hattrick of blockbuster movies

2.Simmba -400 cr and on

Gully Boy,Don't read any reviews just go and watch the film....And judge it yourself..,5
Gully Boy,"Everyone have one movie in life which make them do something, change them, and help them discover themselves and for me GULLY BOY is that kind of movie. This is Ranveer Singh's best performance and best movie till date. The best part of this movie was there was no unwanted gimmicks done to show the character that 'only one' and who had gotten everything ready in his plate like one other recently released movie that came ;~)
Alia Bhatt like always was fabulous although there was not so much for her to do in this movie. All other cast were also great. And special mention for the writers of this movie who brought such a terrific plot in accordance with the character.",5
Gully Boy,"Was happy to see a new style (rapper-based) movie being produced by Bollywood. I am not a fan of such music, but can always appreciate a movie. And, honestly, that was the good part of the movie. Then there are side stories which were more like the 60's style and dragged the movie down - making it boring at times. Alia and Siddhant were the best. Ranveer decent. The finale was a bit let down. Just too much of celebration which didn't emotionally connect with me. I was happy that it was finally over. Compare this movie to Dangal, Secret Superstar, Chak De India, etc. and you will see that it lacks life.",4
Gully Boy,"The similaritieswith 8 Mile is just in the basic premise and whatever was shown in the trailer. This film does stands on its own.
Simple story filled with complex characters (well all the characters from the Gully anyway) beautifully directed. Ranveer Singh is fantastic as expected. The only issue for me was that the climax could have been a bit more intense for such a story.",4
Gully Boy,"Dude I watched it , its overhyped believe me , it's a good movie , that's set , not the movie that u have to watch before you die , movie felt flat in between , & seemed boring at times , boy honestly speaking alia , & that second dude sidhant , over shadowed ranveer Singh , he has again overacted at times , so it's a good movie , but the way these critics & specially people in screening are portraying it it's not like that , so go watch it but just lower your expectations , its a damn honest review",3
Gully Boy,"Somewhere in between I felt as if it is copy of 8 miles and slumdog millionaire. However, the similarity is just in premise.",5
Gully Boy,"Left me speechless!!
Amazed by the actors
Everything is just perfect you should watch this for sure",5
Gully Boy,"The film is watchable for Zoya's direction and Siddhant's performance. There is nothing new in the film - it is the age-old underdog story, and I have seen much better depictions of the underdog story in world cinema. Some sections/ communities of the society may be able to connect with the film and its characters, but I could not. Also, if you are from Mumbai, you may like the film. In terms of performances, Ranveer is better here than in some of his last films. Alia has acted like she always does - just being the normal herself. The real performance for which to check out this film is Siddhant's. This is an actor to watch out for.
Disclaimer: There is too much rap in the film. I have tried to be as impartial in my review as possible - if you are not a fan of this so-called ""music"" like myself, you may not like it.",3
Gully Boy,"I love going to film festivals and one of the main reasons is that in many cases, the films that you get to see at such events will never be shown at regular cinemas but this awful Bollywood film is a total time waster.I'm certainly no expert of Bollywood films, I'm not familiar with the actresses, actors and director involved and can't compare this movie to any others of this kind. I simply watched the film at the cinema because my Indian friend persuaded me. The male lead tried hard but his overacting started getting on my nerves.
What I finally got is one of the worst films to have been premiered at the Berlin festival.Moshe Yandorf.",1
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Dilwale made me glad to be a Westerner, just so I could experience the sheer rush in the glorious way this film simply throws its Indian sensibility in your face. It is one of the most completely, openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film, it is yet completely un-Western, and absolutely invigorating.I found the (rather oddly looped in places) mix of Hindi and English dialog to be a lot of fun to follow (as incomplete as the subtitles sometimes seemed). The Indian/Western pop structure of the songs was entertaining and infectious. The choreography is simply amazing, and some of the most sheerly athletic I've seen. The Indian roots of the dance routines were at first almost unnerving--at once familiar yet bizarre, almost surreal (to my Western eyes). It was sheer fun making the cultural adjustment.The plot is predictable, almost pedestrian--certainly not what you'd call ""never done before,"" and yet I found myself completely absorbed in the story, and rooting for the main characters. This is in large part due to Shahrukh Khan's and Kajol's performances as Raj and Simran. He is totally endearing, and she is totally hot!, and their on screen chemistry is as cute & perky and smoldering & steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was, simply put, fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was, I understand, only 24 when he made Dilwale, and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a world-record 11 years (and may still be going on, as far as I know). A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals, and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra, Khan, and Kajol. What a treat!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Srk-Kajol have worked in a lot of blockbusters together(Baazigar, Karan Arjun, KKHH, K3G) but DDLJ will always be recognized as their best to date. Debutant director Aditya Chopra so perfectly brings these two together at the back-drop of a realistic family setting that its hard not to fall in love with them. Its chemistry at its finest. For Srk it was his first ""Raj"" character(play-girl type guy with the right values and morals) which he plays to perfection. For Kajol, DDLJ was a career making movie. As Simran she's beautiful, sweet, sensitive and a bit stuck-up too. Thank god Madhuri didn't have the dates to work in DDLJ cuz no actress suits Srk better then Kajol. There are countless heart-warming scenes between em' in DDLJ. Each one of them is uniquely different and just as much fun to watch. The entire setting of DDLJ is very simplistic, which brings out that special ""oomph"" in their romance. The songs are first-class. The strong supporting cast of Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Anupam Kher and Satish Shah definitely helped the movie to become the classic as its now seen as.Bottomline: DDLJ is 'romantic comedy' with Indian emotions at its peak. From the cast, chemistry, music, direction and the awesome pairing of Srk-Kajol....its perfect!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"DDLJ has been my all time favourite movie. its a wonderful love story about the second generation Asian youths! Raj the main character played by Shahrukh khan gives a superb performance and equally good as Simran (co-star) played by Kajol!! Its about a girl living in London, who's marriage has been arranged by her father to marry his best friend's son. She accepts her fate until she meets Raj in Europe and falls in love. The movie has won many awards including National Award(in India)for best story. The songs in the movie are also worth listening to, composed by Jatin Lalit which are melodious and romantic. Overall the movie is definitely 10/10, no doubt!!!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I recently took a class about India in college and towards the end of the semester, we watched a few clips from some Bollywood and Tamil movies. I was very moved and inspired by the clips alone! Then, I told my friend (who happens to be Indian) from my work study job invited to an ""Indian Movie Night"" at her dorm. We watched K3G and I was so touched by it! It was simply wonderful. Most of all, I became a SRK and Kajol fan. Their on-screen chemistry is remarkable! I can't explain it! Anyhoo, I asked my mom for some Bollywood movies for Christmas and one of the movies I got was DDLJ. And let me tell ya'll, it is now my favorite movie of all time. SRK and Kajol shine beyond reason in this flick. The script is excellent, everything is excellent especially the acting and memorable songs! The supporting cast (most notably Simran parents, sister and Raj's dad were figging awesome!) Mr. Amish (sic) Puri, who played Kajol's dad acts wonderfully with just his eyes! One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Raj's friend walks into Simran's dad store and says ""Uncle, can I have some beer?!"" Gosh, it's the way that cat said the line that made it so FUNNY! After watching it again yesterday, I realized that I love so many Hollywood movies (particularly classic ones) and yet I couldn't state my all time favorite one. But while watching the making of DDLJ (I own the special edition version with two DVD's inside), I became rather teary eyed. I mean, I'm getting teary eyed writing this review at this moment! This film touched not only my heart, but my soul as well. They are so many underlying messages in DDLJ that can strike a cord in a non-Indian's (like me, I'm Nigerian American) soul. In end, I hope people who read this will buy DDLJ, (Renting will be useless, because you'll want to watch it over and over again...) love this priceless gem of a movie, and this goes out to the girls, wanna ""come...fall in love"" with a cool, crazy, sexy guy like Raj!PS- THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,If you missed this movie than you have missed the best movie made in bollywood history.This movie never seems to bore you.I have saw over a hundred times(Really).It's a fascinating movie.The plot was wonderful.The acting was really award winning.Shahrukh Khan is a gem of an actor.Really incredible acting by him.Kajol was excellent.The songs were awesome!The music was wow.The direction was cool.A must see for those who adore romantic flicks.,5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Probably one of the greatest love stories ever told. Director Aditya Chopra made his debut as a director with this film. Aditya is the son of legendary Director/Producer Yash Chopra who gave us films like Deewar, Darr, Waqt, Kabhie Kabhie, Dil To Pagal Hai and Veer-Zaara.Aditya was one the first Directors of the New Generation of the Indian film Directors. With his first film he got rave reviews and was immediately classified as one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. With DDLJ, Aditya showed us what falling in love, respect, and family values are all about. This film also confirmed the Pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as one of the best in the Indian Cinema. It made Kajol and Shah Rukh superstars over night and two of the most sought after actors.DDLJ also started the trend of love stories in Indian Cinema. Before DDLJ, most Indian films were action films. But DDLJ changed all that and the way of war was changed to a way of love. It's incredible how this film changed the Indian Cinema and the way of making films. DDLJ is a Forever Classic.It recently set a new record for the longest running film when it crossed the 500th week mark (that means it's a 10 time golden jubilee), the previous record was 275 weeks and was held by SHOLAY (another forever classic). All I can say is you must watch this movie, because ""After Raj met Simran, love wasn't the same...come fall in love all over again"".",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This was the top Bollywood film of the 90s and after seeing it I really can't think of one that was better. There are some that are just as good but I can't recall seeing one that's better. The story's pretty routine: boy meets girl in Europe, they fall in love, girl is engaged to some other idiot, and the rest writes itself... Sound familiar? Well it wasn't back in '95 (or even if it was it wasn't done as well) and Aditya Chopra's treatment of the story was a big reason for it's success. In every other movie the couple first wants to kill each other before falling in love. But in this movie it's slightly different and more plausible. Shahrukh doesn't want to kill Kahol - I mean Kajol - and she doesn't really hate him either, she just (like the rest of us) is annoyed by the guy. Their situations aren't that far-fetched and their Europe storyline is played out quite realistically (of course the piano scene is an exception). This was the beginning of the ""Shahrukh plays Shahrukh era"" and, for what it's worth, he hasn't made a better movie or given a better performance since. Sure there are places where he overacts but there are just as many places where he's able to hit all his cues. His comic timing was never better and there was still some sincerity in his eyes, a reminder of the fact that he was still an actor, which has since been replaced by the cockiness of a megastar. This is the movie that shot him to superstardom and put him alongside Aamir and Salman. Kajol is just as good (if not better), and I think after their next movie they'll win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The supporting cast is fine although no one really stands out. There are many moments in the film, most notably in the script, where you might feel a sense of deja vu. But keep in mind that this was the original, it's everything else that's a rehash. Bollywood headed straight for the sewer after this movie with almost all films, many of them starring Shahrukh, copying the same formula. Even at its 3 hour length the movie never drags till after the two-hour mark. I also want to comment on the film's Art Direction because it warrants a mention. Whether it's in Europe, England, or India, the movie has a very natural look to it. Unlike today's big films like Dil To Pagal Hai, or K3G, this movie looks good without trying to look good and I think that's a quality that's been lost on today's films. Too much attention is spent on the look at the expense of the story (if there is one!). The soundtrack of course is a classic, truly one of the all-time bests, with almost every song being a hit. The film won an unprecedented number of awards while breaking many records. There was a feeling that Aditya would follow in his father Yash's footsteps but regrettably the pressure got to him. He followed this up with the dreadful Mohabbatein which was slammed by audiences and critics alike. But so what. His first film was good, and with the current state of Bollywood movies - Devdas anyone? - you really can't get better than this.",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I usually go for Bollywood films for the music-dance numbers. While this flick has a few good ones, I was mostly pleased with the plot. I liked the second half the best. I was very disappointed to learn from IMDb that this is the second of only two films done by Pooja Rupanel. She brought a lot of life and spark to a minor role - the female lead's younger sister. She should have done more films. Like any really good comedy, the story had its serious aspects - just enough to make the plot interesting. The stand=by Bollywood love triangle plot can be used as many times as one wishes as long as one has good actors, terrific musical numbers, and a few novel plot twists.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a superb example of the genius of Hindi commercial cinema. If you see it, you'll get that it's not very different as a love story. It is even ordinary. But it becomes special for many reasons. First and foremost, for its fresh, naive spirit. Secondly, the many paradoxes it contains: it is powerful yet subtle, larger-than-life yet simple, funny yet sad, magical yet realistic, and so on. Thirdly, it is one of the first films portraying Indians who live outside their country (in this case, London). It also shows the yearning of the first-generation NRIs who live far away from their homeland and for many reasons find it difficult to come back. Yet, the film remains mainly a poignant, melancholic romance. Raj and Simran, the characters played by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol represent the last generation of youngsters who were innocent and naive. They were much more simple, respectful and full of life. Such people almost no longer exist nowadays. The film relates their love story in a rather mesmerising way. Every scene is important. There are many great moments in the film. Raj and Simran's entire acquaintance and interaction in the first half is charming. Their separation at the end of the first half, when both make each other understand of their true feelings without explicitly admitting it, is moving. The traditional wedding preparations in the second half are well-made; the values they show, Raj's attempts to conquer Simran's father, and the couple's deepening relationship are interesting. The only thing I regretted was the typical fight scene towards the end.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who undoubtedly form a great film couple, are both excellent in their roles. They act from the heart, and ably bring their characters to life. Shahrukh Khan is incredible as Raj, a modern guy who understands the value of family and marriage, and yet he has the look of a careless fool who does not take anything seriously. Khan acts with great ease, wit and humour, and his inner fear of losing his beloved is always understood. Kajol as the dreamy and poetic yet intransigent and smart Simran is exceptional, and she looks very hot throughout. Amrish Puri and Farida Jalal as Simran's parents provide great support. Amrish Puri is particularly impressive as the strict but soft-hearted father, and Jalal is touching as the woman who has lived life according to terms and does not want the same to happen to her daughter. Anupam Kher is funny and entertaining as Raj's father. The film's soundtrack is outstanding and is clearly one of the main reasons this film works so well and is unforgettable today. The music is very well identified with the film and its story. Just try to imagine you would be given to watch the movie with the songs edited out. You wouldn't want to, right? That's because every song is a gem and is as important as every other scene. Every song comes in the right place and is sung and pictured exceptionally well. The one closest to my heart is ""Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko"", for its beautiful melody and very melancholic feel, which is aided by its blend of fantasy and reality on-screen. It is performed to perfection by Lata Mangeshkar and Udit Narayan. DDLJ is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is one of the great gifts of Yash Chopra and his banner. It is a milestone of Indian cinema for its ability to inject fresh and magical energies into a banal love story, and for making it classically memorable.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I'm sooo in love with this movie. Its way better than Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or any other Hindi film or ANY film in general that I've ever seen! It's that good! I just want to recommend this to everyone ESPECIALLY if your a Shah Ruhk Khan/Kajol fan, they are awesome together. The whole supporting cast does a great job too-  Put together with the beautiful direction of Aditya Chopra they turn a simple storyline of uncliched love into a heartfelt movie you can watch over and over again. Oh, and did I mention the songs rock too!",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Going to the theatre to watch this movie was supposed to be my 'punishment' (for doing what, I can't remember), but let me tell you, this was the best punishment of my life.This movie was fantastic! I found it groundbreaking in that it solidly addressed the doublestandards and idiocy that tend to pervade in the minds of a lot of Indian parents. It was definitely an anti-arranged marriage film, which was a plus.I still watch this movie from time to time, and I have to tell you I thoroughly enjoy it, every time. The songs are great, the actors are great, and the dialogue is pleasing.A timeless classic, that will probably never be repeated.10/10",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"It's like this: Dilwale is no Battleship Potemkin, as my Indian friend who hates Bollywood pointed out to me when I said I preferred to analyse DDLJ than BP for our Analyzing Film exam but, then again, Dilwale is not trying to be.The reason why the movie is great and one of the best I've seen is because it's silly and simple, yes, but also tremendous fun! The songs and dances are truly amazing and, unlike some people believe, the characterisation has depth. I should know because I had to discuss the different distinctive traits that make up all the characters in DDLJ in my exam and people would be surprised at just how layered and complex they are, if they took the time to pay attention (if you don't believe me, read the BFI book on the movie).Also, the picture has no pretentiousness: unlike Devdas, which was so melodramatic I'm surprised the whole cast didn't die from the agony of having to act in such an overrated and over the top Romeo and Juliet ripoff (people scream all the time especially Aishwarya Rai who is the most hysterical of them all), DDLJ succeeds exactly because it's happy just giving us a magical young love story, which we could all relate to anyway but which is made even better because of the 1st rate performances given by everyone involved.Kudos to Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol (my two favourite Bollywood actors), for creating such an intense, believable yet innocent and pure chemistry that made their love scenes just so sweet, beautiful and really heart-felt to watch.I'm not saying that just because we are capable of enjoying this movie, we aren't capable of enjoying something more intellectual and political like Battleship Potemkin.But it's nice to watch a movie once in a while that is not depressing nor always giving us extreme scenes of violence and sex with which Hollywood seems to be obsessed with.Nowadays movies just seem to feature people who think life is not worth living, are always suicidal and spend their time doing sex and drugs. Maybe these sort of characters should be pitied or something but, frankly, they're beginning to bore me. I've seen enough movies featuring these sort of personages to last me a lifetime. Give me a character who's happy with life and not afraid to have fun anytime!Much like the celebrated Singin' In The Rain, DDLJ is fun, leaves you feeling elated, has funny dialogue and you can feel the love that everybody involved felt about the production, which increases the quality of the picture!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This movie is one of my alltime favourites! The plot although not new is perfect, which is probably why it has been used so many times. Raj and Simran fall in love while touring through Europe and when they get home, Simran is supposed to be married off to India. What I love so much about Bollywood, is all in here. First of all, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are the perfect couple. They interact so well, everything fits. Second, The music is so great, I played the DVD a week or so until I got the CD. Third, we first see the cultural environment of London and Europe, which is contrasted very nice against India with all the fantastic colourful clothing. Fourth nice story components and Dialugues. The only reason for me not to give full 10 stars, is because off the dreadful late 80ies clothes (obviously the 80ties in India lastet deep into the nineties and because I want to spare a star for Khabi Khushi Khabi Gham, which is in my opinion still the best Hindi movie ever.",4
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I'm not going to get too much into reviewing the story of this movie, most of the other reviews are covering that for you. Honestly I don't remember too much the story that well anyways beyond the basics. Besides this is a Bollywood film, you know the melodramatic story of a boy and girl who fall in love against their parents wishes. I'll stick to a more cultural commentary. I remember 1995's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge being a good movie that dealt with second generation Indians living in England. This was a funny film that struck a chord with younger Indians living in Western countries around the world, and it was an obvious smash hit in India as well. Let me say that every country in the world has something ""cool"" or ""bad ass"" about it. But India has often had the most uncool, nerdy stereotypes about it. When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, most of the representation of Indians in Western culture was limited to Apu from The Simpsons. Taxi drivers, convenience store clerks, curry, cow worshipers, more curry, thick English accents, effeminate men and hairy women,... nothing here was ever cool (these stereotypes are still here, yet are finally changing, albeit slowly). What kind of crazy kid wanted to be Indian? If I could have gotten away with passing myself off as a Mexican, I probably would have tried it. But then there was Bollywood, showcasing the beautiful people of India that could dance and sing just as good as anyone on MTV. This was the cool side to India. It made India look beautiful, exotic, young, hip and cultured. One of the biggest audiences for Bollywood flicks outside of India had traditionally been Indian girls. Older audiences obviously watched too, but young Indian women growing up in America have always been keen to Bollywood, many years before the arrival of DDLJ. Bollywood models, gharba dances, since as long as I can remember Indian girls immediately zeroed in on knowing that Bollywood was a cool piece of Indian pop culture that non-Indians didn't have access too or couldn't immediately claim as ""theirs"". Instead of being impenetrably ""foreign"", this industry made India look much more ""exotic"". I suppose it's the better balance to all those National Geographic specials that showed nomads in India eating the most disgusting things imaginable. Like all Indian movies, Bollywood flicks are overacted with dumb plots and idiotic fight scenes, but it involves outrageously beautiful people dancing and singing and that's always going to be cool. Beautiful people can make almost anything look cool. If Apu from The Simpsons has an arranged marriage then from the Western point of view it may look backward, cruel and dorky. If Aishwarya Rai or Hrithik Roshan has an arranged marriage, then it seems much more exotic and cultured,...hey maybe there's something to the concept. Beautiful or well accomplished people can turn previously weirdo things about a country into something cooler then it used to be perceived as. People are damn superficial aren't they? (Bollywood stars all being so fair skinned is a topic for another time) But DDLJ had a cross over appeal that didn't just include Indian girls. It was the first film that I remember being ""big"" amongst Indians. When I say it was ""mainstream"" I don't really mean that it fully crossed over into non-Indian audiences (though I know it did), but rather this is was the first Bollywood movie that I remember that was widely talked about and had immense appeal among many different types of Indian American audiences. Before the release of this film, Bollywood movies seemed to exist in their own little niche of loyal cult followers (usually young Indian women). Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge broke some of the rules and didn't just appeal to Indian girls who wished they could be in a Bollywood movie and marry some hunky fair skinned North Indian guy. No this film had an exposure to a broader audience that seemed to really put Bollywood on the map for Indians that grew up outside of India. Indian guys were into this film, yeah probably because Indian girls were into it, but it was big change from what was going on before. A movie about second generation Indians was automatically going to appeal to every Indian growing up in Europe, Canada, Australia and of course the U.S. This was newer territory and since then Bollywood films have increasingly become more youth targeted in their marketing campaigns. Despite plenty of moments of stupidity (I remember a ridiculous ""Yeeeeeeaahhhhhhhh!!"" yell by Raj during a game of rugby), this movie was the beginning of a small change in Indian culture. Indian exposure to non-Indians and the dispelling of stereotypes is still very much a work in progress and people are unlikely to mention DDLJ on history papers in the future, but it had a milestone effect in my opinion within the community. The overtly glitzy Hrithik Roshan stuff today in 2006 seems a bit more aimed at pre-teen girls (so it's gone even younger), but DDLJ was the most talked about film in the 90s. 11 years have gone by, Shahrukh Khan is nearly 41 years old, he's basically an ""Uncle"" today, a status a lot of Gen-X Indian Americans are creeping towards. Of course Bollywood is a silly representation of India, it's like someone in Mumbai watching Rambo and thinking that's America. But for a brief moment in the mid 90s, people were united in talking about this Hindi movie, regardless if they spoke Hindi, Tamil or Malayalam. The movie had a great cast and awesome dance numbers, along with a more humorous angle then previous flicks I had seen. Recommended.",0
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"If you are reading this review to see if the film is worth seeing, where have you been hiding for the last few years?This film is brought from the stables of Yash Chopra. As you may have guessed it is a 3 way story. Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is a modern Indian guy living in London with his father, played by Anupam Kher. He decides to go on a Eurorail holiday with a couple of his friends and easily gets his rich father's approval. Simran (Kajol) also lives in London but is of much more traditional upbringing, in part due to her strict father (Amrish Puri). Her father starts to reckon that it is time for her to get married. She has no option but to agree. However, she asks her father for the chance to see Europe once with her friends and Amrish Puri is not keen on this at all. Much persuasion follows and reluctantly he agrees.As luck would have it, Raj and Simran and both of their sets of friends end up on the same train and visiting the same places in Europe. At first she detests him. However, she eventually becomes stranded in a remote part of Switzerland with him. All their friends are in the next location. Time passes, songs are sung and lo and behold the two begin to fall in love.The first part of the film ends as the two characters are back in London with their respective families. Amrish Puri overhears Simran talking about the events of the holiday and hits the roof. He packs the bags and takes his family back to the small village in Punjab where they come from. Raj is spurred on by Anupam Kher who says if something is worth having, he must chase after it.The second part of the film consists of Raj trying to win the trust and confidence of Simran's Punjabi family. It consists of several excellent comedy and song scenes. I will leave you to guess what happens in the end.This film does not really warrant superlatives. It is better than excellent. It is as near perfect as we are likely to ever see. Like I say, if you have not seen this film, where have you been? The soundtrack is classic. Everyone knows the words to ""Tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam"" and ""Mehndi laga ke rakhna.""The performance of the actors is first class. This really is the film that took Shahrukh to superstardom. Kajol also gives an incredible performance. This is the role that really made her name and deservedly so. Anupam Kher does a top comedy role and all the other actors have put in a magnificent performance.This really is a ""feel-good"" movie. If you have not seen it yet, make it your next priority to see the film. If you have, watch it again! This film, along with Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and more recently Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are the quintessential 1990's definition of excellent Hindi cinema. Take your family, as refreshingly, there is no sex, bad language or violence in any of the three films.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I just loved this film. I have seen it many times but still it's very entertaining, and a great family film to watch. Great story and brilliant actors in it. I just love Shah Rukh Khan and he is the best in this film along with other as well. Kajol is looking great and performance is the best too. If you have missed out this film then that means you have not watched a film that you can never forget. Come fall in love with it all over again. By seeing this movie you can feel like that you also want to love Raj or Simran too. Movie just brilliant movie. I can't express so much words but I think its just the best romantic movie ever made in film history. It had won the largest amount of awards that any other film has got. Shah Rukh as best actor, Kajol as best actress. Adi as best director, Best Film of the year, best play back singer Udit. Best supporting male and supporting female. And so many other awards as well. I just say that don't miss this flick. I give it a 1000/1000.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Dilwale dulhania Le jayenge is one of the bestest film in the world! Shah rukh khan is one of the main factor of the films great success, i absolutely loved it. It was hilarious and felt heart warming! I think everyone in the film did a great job. It made Shah rukh Khan rise to more fame as well as Kajol, because people wanted to see them act together more because of the chemistry between them. this movie and Devdas is a great credit to shahrukh khan, because you can see how Shah rukh khan has matured through acting. the best part of the film, is the fact that you see in other films where the lovers both want to runaway because the parents wont let them be together, whereas this film suggests that running away doesn't solve the problem. the other factor makes the film better is the fact that shahrukh khan himself went through the similar situation in 1994.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"This film is for anyone who has forgotten the meaning of life. It clearly demonstrates the power of love and its ability to move heaven and earth. This is much more than a movie. It is a gift for those whose hearts have been hurt, abused and misused. It is one of those rare occurrences where you can witness the real heart of Mother India in all her unobstructed glory. ""Shahrukh Kahn"", who plays Raj, is not merely an actor. He is the incarnation of one of those great Indian souls or teachers who is the embodiment of love. It is an incomparable privilege here to see him in his element. ""Amrish Puri"" is the quintessential Indian patriarch who is immovable in his dignity and beliefs. Beliefs that for him mean no less than the continuation of his Hindu ancestry. ""Kajol"", who plays Simran, is a true Indian princess. She will not disobey her father but she cannot ignore her heart or her love with Raj. I cannot praise ""Aditya Chopra"" enough for bringing this masterpiece to life. The direction is romantic, sweeping you up with every scene. You do not feel you are watching a film as much as experiencing a whirlwind. I must also mention that the music is true joy and inspiration and is essential to the whole package. The title song is magnificent. Thank you ""Jatin-Lalit."" This film will make you feel like you have not felt in a long time. See this movie and live again.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"I am writing this review after watching the movie more than 5 times. The movie have very fine music, great presentation , very romantic story and so nice on screen chemistry between Shahruk and Kajole. Its a movie after which one want to fall in love. I think for Indian audiences the name of the movie is enough. I don't remember any movie in this genre to commensurate with this one. This movie comes out to be all time hit. So if you are feeling like to watch some musical drama, go for it again and again. One can also watch maine pyar kiya, jab we met, socha na tha etc for similar entertainment. I liked the acting of Mandira too. The way she falls for shahruk. The way she sees her faster heartthrobs.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,this movie is related to Indian culture although its based on NRI's. in first half Shahrukh(Raj) falls in love with Simran(Kajol) and in second half he makes the successful attempt to take away Simran as his bride by doing all things right. he had a easier option of taking away Simran without consent of her family but he chose the difficult way of proving himself the right person for her. the music of the movie is splendid and story is perfect. i don't have any more comments for this movie as the fact proves itself its simply THE BIGGEST hit of Indian movie industry till date. if you are an Indian then only you can appreciate this however it will make sense to others also..,5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"DDLY was one of my first Hindi movies I have seen, and from the beginning I was in love with it. It really touched me by its love, simplicity and warmth. After DDLY I have seen many Hindi movies (still loving them very much), but none of them were as well as DDLY, and I really think that the movie is Shahrukhs and Kajols best performances. Their best scene together is I think the scene after the song ""Zarasa Jhoom Loon Main"" when Kajol find herself in a bed wearing Shahrukhs shirt and with his cloth on the bed. Then she asks him what happened last night, and off course he makes a joke that something happened. But just then you see his magic when he tries to comfort Kajol by saying: ""I know what you think of me, you think I'm a wastrel. But I'm no scum, I'm a Hindustani, and I know what honor means for a Hindi woman, and I would never even imagine that doing with you in my dreams"" A great line, that clearly says how Shahrukh is.",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"My ever favorite movie.Man i can watch this movie no matter what.I have the tendency to leave all my work just to see this movie.After watching this one i fell in love with Shahrukh.Even today he is just too sweet as a lover and well he is too sweet in any role.:-D..... Anyways where the movie is concerned there can't be anything so sweet and simple as the love shown between the two leads.When this movie completed 500 weeks i actually went and saw it all over again in the hall just to relive the charisma and magic of the movie and the feeling of the true love and romance that this movie generates and one on which i have grown up.The caption 'Come.....fall in love' seems to be made for this movie as as many times as u watch it you will fall in love again and again not just with the movie or shahrukh or the chemistry of the lead pair but also with the very emotion called LOVE!!!!!!!Now about the movie....well i won't be doing justice if i name anyone mind-blowing scene as all of them are just too good.But still one scene does no matter what remain my fave is the one towards the end of the Europe trip where Shahrukh and Kajol are standing on the bridge where he questions her what if you would have fallen in love with someone on this trip,say for example me,then also will you still go and get married.On this kajol just stares and him and when he just laughs and says i was joking.She just gives him an exasperated look and walks away.He just stands there and chants...Palat,Palat,willing her to turn around and look at him if she loves him.The moment she looks back at him as she is boarding the train he just jumps up with true unadulterated joy of a man truly in love.The thing that pulls at my heart string is the very innocence of the feelings portrayed by the two of them.Well i can keep raving about this movie all day so closing on the note that its a must watch for all those who are in love.believe in it or have ever loved anyone.You will find a part of your love story shown in some or the other scene of the movie......COME.......FALL IN LOVE!!!!!!!!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"The movie is truly wonderful, and one of the best Bollywood has ever produced. I am almost tempted to give it 10 out of 10. However, I would take a point out for not doing a great job on cinematography - but the movie is truly a superb from every other aspect, so felt bad taking a point off. The Switzerland alps look great as backdrops, however, a true cinematographer can create the magic in its absence too!Direction & script: superb! Kudos to Aditya Chopra on an awesome job. Many Hindi movies focus so much on lead characters, sometimes they forget the supporting cast. This movie shows the supporting cast are not just a prop for the story, they have characters too! You cannot ignore a single character - apart from major characters like the Father of bride (Amrish Puri), mother (Farida Jalal), even the characters of Kuljit & his father (Satish Shah) too are well taken care of! Very few movies (like Sholay) are so strong on giving importance to each and every characters.The movie truly deserves all the 11 awards it got! The movie is surely the best for the SRK & Kajol duo. It touches every sense beautifully, so you never feel tired of watching it over and over again.Music: It may not be the best Jatin Lalit has every produced, but it perfectly suits the movie. And of course all the songs have been very well choreographed, so the music video is imprinted on everyone's mind.This movie was a milestone in opening up Bollywood's business abroad! It's got all the elements that appeals to an NRI audience. Bollywood has never looked back after this movie got so many accolades all over the world.Thanks to Aditya Chopra for crafting such a gem, hard to believe its his debut movie!This is the best movie of 90's and surely enough, it will remain in top 10 Bollywood has ever produced!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"It was one of my first *new* Bollywood movies that I have seen and I loved it. After the brooding heroes of the 70's and 80's Raj Malhotra was like a fresh breeze. The music is quite good, the characters are believable (and I swear I lived door to door with Simran's babuji a couple of years ago ;-)) and the love story is just cute. A bit dated when watched after ten years, but that is to be expected.Love the movie, love the music, but first of all I love Simran and Raj - Kajol and SRK do a very good job and have cemented their standing as Jodi #1 with this movie as well as with the following KKHH and K3G. Good family entertainment - THUMBS UP!",5
Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,"Ever since its release, me and my family have seen this movie 50, 60, 70, well to be honest, I don't even remember how many times. This movie has some kind of magic in it nobody knows why, but every time the movie is played, nobody among us, can resist to watch it completely. I have watched a lot of Indian movies, you name it, but at the same time, I don't watch every movie and I don't like most of the movies. But this one, it looks as if every single clip was done to the perfection.I have seen in lots of TV shows, that people compare Karan and Aditya. But to me, after watching DDLJ, KKKG, KKHH, M (mohabbatein), KHNH, I don't think there is any comparison between the two. Aditya's both movies are truly professional, script is so powerful and direction is so well done and the tempo is created in such a way that its very hard to find a mistake. Where as in KKKG, KKHH, KHNH on a lot of situations the movie seems to run out of hand. Handling of characters is not perfect nor is the script.This movie is truly a classy master piece which are not made every other day. Thats why, truly and deservedly it ran consecutively on one cinema screen for more than 6 years. WAO !!!!!!!",0
Wonder Park,"I just love it. June herself is a understandable character and has a very realistic real life personality. Basically June is the typical dreamerthat finds out that life bites back and that's a good thing. If your going into watching this show now, its not going to be too easy due to his personality, but the more you watch it you will start to see how June actually handles trying to connect with people from her past and how he can stay relevant in todays media. With witty (and cutways too) jokes and pretty reasonable emotional moments, its a cartoon that makes you feel apart of the multiple situation he is in and always wonder whats going to happen next, its hooks you at a different physiological level that other animated see that as a good thing!",5
Wonder Park,"Hehehe. Don't bring your ADULT brain into the theater! We LOVED it! This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie for Children, so just let your imagination soar. It has Wonderment, Great Graphics, a Great Soundtrack... And Interesting Characters. A lot of Adults are trying to put Adult Blinders on a Kid's Movie, then trying to Criticize it. That is NOT what is going on!The Imaginary Pretend Rides are for the Imagination. Some Grown-ups have lost theirs.Goto the 3D Version... To enjoy the Rides! We did and LOVED it! All Classic Kid Films have a bit of a Dark Theme, or they aren't any good. Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella come to mind. Completely throw out about your Kids being miserable or confused. They will look past it, because it has a nice endingAs I mentioned at the top... This is NOT for entertaining ADULTS, as much as it is the Kids, despite many Adults trying to READ Adult themes into it. That's NOT the Point! If you leave your Adult Brain outside the theater... You'll absolutely enjoy this ... I KNOW your Kids will... I have not heard one single complaint yet. And Grandparents that take the Grandkids absolutely Loved it too!
(I've talked to a few that are friends. ) Have FUN!",5

A story about faith and resilience, finding our inner strenght and not giving up on our dreams.
In life there are dark and bright moments, and its important to not loose ourselves, forgetting the magic inside of us.Don't miss this magical story!! I Loved it!!",5
Wonder Park,"So first off this movie is just amazing. It had me laughing, crying and just filled with emotion and investment throughout the whole movie.You will notice an unfortunatly large amount of negative reviews about this movie and I have to say please moderate the ones you know have no thought in them.The ones I speak of are every single one that only says ""this movie is sad. My kid didn't like it. Not for under 6.""OF COURSE IT'S NOT!So for parents. Here's the thing, judge movies you wanna show your kids based on how you wanna raise them but please think before you simply just say something that has absolutely no actual thought behind it as it does impact the enjoyment older kids get from studios endeavors.This is the first non SpongeBob (ugh) nickelodeon movie in decades. An original ip that came out of nowhere. Think very carefully about that. The reason is because SpongeBob is known, ""safe"" even though it clearly isn't smart for the most part after its first half of seasons, and parents just don't want to think too hard about what their kids see.This. Is. A. Horrible way to watch movies for ANYONE! Not just kids. You can not care what you watch but kids need stimulating thought provoking innovative ideas that will carry them through the world they have to navigate and learn about. So being sad is an emotion of which kids feel and need to feel and discuss with you a parent in order to grow.So where does that leave this movie? Mixed honestly. Someone like me loved it for it's imagination, it's heart, the main character and her drive to invent, create and ultimately rediscover why it's important to do so after something that happens to bury those feelings.The mixed part comes into play when you as an older person who knows how to analyze movies and characters. The message of the movie can be confusing. This is purely a matter of perspective so I can only give mine and if someone disagrees then they are free too. Just don't say ""it's stupid cause it's sad and I don't wanna watch sad things with my kid's"". To which I say, here's a happy meal, your hamster ball and a wall with no paint. I'd let you watch the paint dry but we wouldn't wanna get too exciting or dare I say...... CREATIVE!The inventions in this movie are an absolute pleasure to see come to life. And I don't mean literally either even though that's also fun. I mean to see a child think of these wonderful ideas and be encouraged by their parents to think of even greater more fun ways to look at them even if the kid thinks you as the smarter parent could probably come up with something better. It's how it should be since the child is taught that their ideas matter and they are important to express in only words they can say.Overall without spoiling too much I will say you will enjoy this movie if you are looking for a character that is strong, creative and finds out why it's important to be that way.If you aren't then that's ok. There are plenty of fine movies you can watch. Just make sure that they have heart and don't always play it safe. A Disney movie can be scary and that's good. A nickelodeon movie can be sad and that's ok. A warner bros movie can have crazy amounts of creativity. All movies can have inappropriate humor if you py attention to what they sneak in. Nothing is meant to be sacred and nothing is truly safe. Take a chance, have fun and explore. Your heart will thank you for it.",5
Wonder Park,"The central character in Wonder Park is an 8-year-old girl who nearly destroys her neighborhood with a homemade roller coaster and whose mother is desperately ill. Did I mention that it's an animated film geared to kiddies?
This Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Movies production seeks to deliver an inspirational message about the power of imagination. But like so many animated movies these days, it buries its ideas in a visual and aural cacophony of frenzied action sequences designed to engage the shortest of attention spans. It also features a gallery of would-be adorable animal characters so obviously designed to fly off toy store shelves that you expect the merchandise to be on sale in the theater lobby.
As is also usual these days, an overqualified cast of well-known performers has been recruited to provide the voices, even though the young target audience is unlikely to care that the little girl's parents are played by Jennifer Garner and Matthew Broderick. The animal characters are given life by more distinctive voices including Kenan Thompson and Ken Jeong, although when you hear John Oliver as a British-accented porcupine, you almost expect the little critter to launch into a deep-dive monologue about net neutrality or immigration reform.
The little girl, June, is voiced by Brianna Denski. (The young actress reportedly beat out 1,500 others for the role.) A whiz at math, June has created an imaginary theme park, dubbed Wonderland, populated by characters inspired by her stuffed animals. They include chimpanzee impresario Peanut (two-time Tony Award winner Norbert Leo Butz, infusing his exuberant performance with welcome theatricality); Boomer (Ken Hudson Campbell), a bear who welcomes visitors; Steve (Oliver), a porcupine in charge of park safety; Greta (Mila Kunis), the boar on whom Steve has a helpless crush; and Cooper (Jeong) and Gus (Thompson), the beavers who handle maintenance.
After June's mom is forced to leave home to seek treatment (what is it with the apparent desire of animated film creators to traumatize their young audiences?), June bitterly burns the meticulous blueprints for Wonderland and reluctantly heads off to math camp. But she runs away almost immediately, and while wandering in the woods encounters a real-life version of her imaginary theme park.
But all is not well in Wonderland, and it's not only because the park's name was presumably too evocative of Alice in Wonderland to provide the film's title (you'd think someone would have thought of that at some point during production). It seems that Peanut has gone missing and a mysterious darkness has descended on the park, which has also been invaded by a horde of ""chimpanzombies,"" who are about as appealing as they sound. June resolves to save the park, with predictable and increasingly tiresome mayhem-filled set pieces ensuing.
Featuring unappealing, prosaic CGI animation, the pic is strictly geared toward very young, undiscriminating tastes despite the frequent inclusion of adult-targeted lines of dialogue such as the bear explaining, ""I started to make mushroom calzones"" and another creature lamenting his ""existential crisis.""",5
Wonder Park,"This movie is not like other animations. It is beautiful, colorful and cheery. It also has some interesting existential and intelligent parts that is applicable to both kids and growing adults.

There was still some places where the movie could have become legendary.",5
Wonder Park,"My 6 year old son was so concentrate in the movie

Wonder Park,"This movie was by far one of the best animated movies of the spring movie season. In reality, this was the splat's first ORIGINAL animated theatrical release since 2006 with Barnyard. By god, this movie was amazing and has a really cool story.
Sad thing is... No one was laughing in the theater except me! The jokes were fresh, Characters were moving along the tracks, and the animation was just freaking beautiful!
I would say that Nickelodeon has pulled a miracle out of its bag of tricks. This movie was so heartfelt, wonderful, and just overall a family-friendly movie that would really made families agree that this is probably the best work out of the splat's studio since Barnyard back in 200614 years in the making, it was worth every penny! I even stood and applauded as the credits roll cause it was just that good! Bring this to heart next time you criticize a movie like this... Its all about the imigination and the heart. And this movie does both!",5
Wonder Park,"I watched this movie with 2 daughters together. Movie show how about imagine world, about family love, about friendship. That's great.Why you vote it bad?",5
Wonder Park,"Saw this with my family and not only did my wife and I enjoy it but my 4 year old son loved it as well. He loved the park and the characters and I think some of the more serious and sad parts are a little over his head he still seemed to understand why she was sad. It was a tear jerker for my wife. The wonder of the movie really is the magic of childhood and the possibilities that come along with it. Unfortunately, life has a way of getting in the way of our potential but with the help of trusted friends and loved ones you can find yourself and get back.",5

June, a wonderful girl full of imagination, discovers an incredible amusement park called Wonderland hidden in the woods, however the park is in disarray, due to the darkness.

Wonder Park,"A well written animated film, tries to make us remember the wonder of our imagination. And what it was like going to a popular amusement park, like Disney World and Six Flags.
I like the animation, although the story is fun, but nothing real special. I do like the characters, they really come alive. Scenes of the Wonder Park are amazingly well drawn. Actors doing the voices are good too. This is a good film to take your family to see, but it's a film you could only see one time, that is my opinion, but a kid could enjoy this many times more.",4
Wonder Park,"I can't believe my eyes, this title got less than 8 stars, that is awful !Yes, movie can be a little hard for children at the beginning, but so what ? Children must learn, face the problems and start realizing adult stuff too. (By the way, kids react and realizing that better, than most of the adults)This animation is hell of a good! It is colorful, sensitive, full of real experiences, imagination and has everything, a good fairytale must have.The quality is wonderful, one of the best 3Ds I've ever seen. Soundtracks fit perfectly and give chills every single time.HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!Finished watching few minutes ago and just can't find other words, TRULY WONDERFUL.",5

Wonder Park,"Wonder Park, written by Josh Applebaum and Andre Nemec, is a touching film and a magical adventure. It is filled with action, humor and heartfelt moments that make it enjoyable. The movie is all about the power of love and imagination. It is a wild ride of fun.The movie tells the story of a young girl, June Bailey, (Sofia Mali and Brianna Denski). She is very imaginative and adventurous, which shows throughout the movie. She and her mom (Jennifer Garner) have a very close relationship. Together they invent a theme park called Wonderland, based on figments from June's imagination. It is a whimsical place filled with exciting rides and attractions, such as a flying fish carousel and crazy roller coasters. The park has great characters like Boomer, the narcoleptic bear and Steve, a gentle porcupine. There is also Greta, a feisty hog and a beaver Cooper played by the hilarious Ken Jeong. My favorite character is the monkey Peanut (Norbert Leo Butz), the leader of the park. He is such an endearing character. When June's love for the park is tested, the magic of what she and her mom created begins to disappear. It's up to June to save the park and herself.The plot is creative. I like the animation and the magical looking effects. I love the vision of the park and the details that capture the theme of a child's mind. All of the areas of the park are vibrant and unique. I love the bendy straw slide and the balloon cove. The scenes match the mood of what occurs in the storyline. One of my favorite parts is when June first comes to Wonderland and sees that her creations are real.The movie has some emotional moments between June and her mother. We see how June goes from being a happy-go-lucky kid to a sad little girl. We watch her love for the park fade away. However, we see her get her shine back. It is a great story about relationships and the importance of imagination and always believing.I rate this film 4 out 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 to 13, as well as the entire family.Reviewed by Jordan M., KIDS FIRST!

Devarattam,"A fairly watchable movie that contemplates social issues of young women, dealt in violence and a good message for all.",4
Rang De Basanti,"The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichs, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed.",5
Rang De Basanti,"It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these ""leisure"" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference.",5
Rang De Basanti,"If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year.",5
Rang De Basanti,"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace",5
Rang De Basanti,"all the people who are waiting for good, original and well executed Indian film . the wait is over for you people.

No wonder... it gives you real life look..",5
Rang De Basanti,"Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating *****'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a clich patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fianc is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding",5
Rang De Basanti,"I have watched this movie today on the Republic Day of India, and I was really left speechless with the movie. It ranks among the very best movies. The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country.",5
Rang De Basanti,"Aamir strikes back guys. Its the movie of the year. Simply amazing performances by all. Though i felt that the movie dragged just a little bit in the beginning, the second half was amazing. The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The performance of Soha Ali Khan was better than I had expected. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it.",5
Rang De Basanti,"The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye opener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits.",4
Rang De Basanti,"Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens.",5
Rang De Basanti,"Movies we view come and go, releasing from our minds; however, this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just ""wow"", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D.",5
Rang De Basanti,"This year gets a perfect start with Rang de Basanti...A movie that is so contemporary...After movies like Dil chahta ha, Black this one really hits me as something new and something different..to start with the story and direction is avant grade and not to forget the acting which has been outstanding...the story has been well thought out..the characters well skated as perfect as when they die in the end the casualness that they depict touches your heart...things they do in the heat of the moment becomes a realization that even they are unaware of and then the big one the climax...many didn't like it..But i just loved it...Bollywood has to learn from this movie to make climaxes like this..the back ground score is outstanding and needs a round of applause..and the cinematography is an institution for aspiring cinematographers....the movies ends on a sad note and still leaves you with a smile...believe me very few movies make that happen... Once again Amir has proved the fact that he is a rock solid actor and the new bunch of actor are a boon to the film and hats off to Rakeshy Mehar for giving us those goose bums and those moments of pride and realization in a much more contemporaries style...It sure did Paint my heart yellow",4
Rang De Basanti,"The tag line of the film says it all, A generation awakens. This is an attempt to awaken the generation X to the reality, to encourage them to make a difference without giving lengthy lectures and preaches on patriotism and nationalism. So, does the film succeed in doing so..?? Well to a large extent it does. The film manages to invoke the feeling for the nation without any heavy dose of loud hardcore patriotic dialogues. The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography, direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 10/10 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved.",4
Rang De Basanti,"When I first watched Rang De Basanti, it started out as a fair film, telling the story of a group of friends making a film about freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his friends. As it progressed on i realized, well Aamir has done better than Mangal Panday. Then after the intermission, i said, ""hmmmm...good film"" and i don't say that easily. But when the film ended i thought ""Finally symbolism has returned to Indian cinema, and Aamir has regained his status as a superstar."" Aamir Khan easily outclasses himself and all the other performances in 2006 and breathtakingly acts very naturally. This performance is unlike any of his previous ones and certainly the best performance by an actor of his age. I'd even say that he outclasses Mr. Bachan in Black and Paa. For this two reasons are present. No.1 both of the roles by Amitabh in Black and Paa were overplayed and both films were copies from two very good Hollywood flicks. The rest of the cast is also very well put together and each and everyone pulls off a decent performance. The soundtrack of the film is perfect for its mood and this is coming from someone who does not, under any circumstances acknowledge A.R Rahman as the Mozart of India. I'd recommend this film to anyone who has taste for good cinema and who loves films with a message, because at the end the message in the film is what makes it memorable. Hats off to Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, Aamir Khan and A.R. Rahman and a memorable thank you to the supporting cast that made this film the best of 2006 (in my opinion).",5
Rang De Basanti,"RDB is the rise of a new genre of films for today's youth that will be hailed as one of the all time classics. If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the pre-independence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word 'Go' in this over critical world is stunning.I've watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding ""doing"" rather than ""gossipping"" and ""being a spectator or passenger in the so called 'system'"". We have all been there, we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.A virtual tag line ""Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota, Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai"" is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals, at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India, myself included.R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB, one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rub-in with the government regarding MIG's. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldn't be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIG's.Aamir Khan as DJ (short for Diljeet) has essayed a role that is funny yet focused, comic yet concerned, silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombay-ite to transform into this ever so likable Dilli-ite with that awesome Punjabi ""oye pehen de takke.."" transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.Siddharth as Karan Singhania & Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just ""Loathes India"" and becomes the voice of the 5 man ""Rebels with a cause"" is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman, not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJ's jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a ""fighting for a cause"" saga from a light one.Now, the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next ""Angry, Sensitive and Sensible"" young man.I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 10/10 for sure.",5
Rang De Basanti,"This film's absurdly high rating insinuates all that is wrong with today's urban Indian youth. Before I get into all the bashing, I have to give credit where it is due. I have to agree that the movie is technically strong; the cinematography is charming, Rahman's music is one of his best, editing is crisp, and the acting is mostly above par and a few outstanding. Where the movie fails, is in its core theme and the message it tries to convey. A group of college students who are indifferent to the problems of the country, as most of us are, suddenly one day gear up to kill the Defence Minister of the country because they 'think' he is responsible for their friend's(an airforce pilot) death. They are utterly convinced that their friend died because of the mediocre parts that went into the manufacturing of the crashed MiG plane, despite having no evidence to establish this whatsoever. They never for once bother to think that the minister could be innocent. What is sickening is the way their act is hailed at the end as if it was the most heroic thing ever done on the face of the earth. The movie constantly compares these half-boiled-attitude youth with the revolutionaries of the Indian freedom struggle which I think is an insult to those real heroes. The plot holes are many. The attack on the people peacefully protesting by the police in the presence of media is simply ridiculous to be real. Now, icing on the cake was the climax,when these 'nationalists' break into a radio station to confess and justify their action. I am not sure of what did these guys think would happen after they confess and allege the minister of corruption on AIR? The country would rise against the government?? when clearly it didn't happen when the innocent people were beaten black and blue in the presence of media! We Indian youth are susceptible to the mob-mentality. The director has exploited it thoroughly. Now, this movie has gained the cult status among the urban dudes because, as a quote in the movie goes, it is easy to grumble about all the ills in the country (and kill its minister) than changing the society for the good, say by becoming an IAS/IPS officer- which requires quite a struggle than stupidly throwing up your life that serves nothing.PS: I would have given this movie a 6/10. But, 1 is just a feeble attempt to bring it to its deserving position.",1
Rang De Basanti,"The movie is one of the marvels of the Indian Theatre ,beautifully blending historical flashes with modern settings .All aspects of the movie including acting,music,cinematography are excellent and it is a must see for ones who are looking for an ""out of the box"" movie.At the same time I would like to say that I personally am not in favor of the ending.I feel that is a very wrong message that the Indian youth is getting.The idea of trying to wake up the society with extreme measures is inappropriate.Killing people is never a solution for any malice that is ingrained in the population.The same idea during the independence revolution was totally different and i respect that totally being a strong patriot myself but the movie is a bad example for the young people who already have fire in their blood and cannot think rationally.The movies have a great impact especially on young people and many try to imitate them.If a system has to be changed it has to be done by intellectual stimulation and general awareness not killing ""the bad guy""!.We have to teach our youth the same thing. Having said that I would like to say that the director definitely has the right to project his thoughts but I differ about the message the movie gives and thought its worth sharing my ideas with everyone.",4
Rang De Basanti,"Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends, their bonding, the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past, when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first, but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell, is not a ripoff of some exotic film, but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical, and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end, but the film has more gems when it comes to performances: Siddharth is excellent, Atul Kulkarni is fantastic, Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation, Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance, her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe, Steven Mckintosh, K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately, despite sharing the screen space with others, this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor, playing a character 15 years younger, lives the role, conveying the right amount of mischief (as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language), carefree flippancy, earnestness, insecurity, even breaking down on screen, and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well, in the movie its said "" I always thought that there are two kinds of men; those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind"" Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too, There are movies made with some moral(some underlying message), some are pure entertainers, not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought, a thought...................",5
Rang De Basanti,"This movie condones the use of violence as a means to bring about change in society. This in general is an interesting viewpoint that deserves cinematic analysis, since according to many, it is justifiable when society is subjected to tyrannical rule, usually by an external aggressor. But the society depicted in this film is modern India - yes corrupt India, but also India of the free press, universal adult franchise, world's largest democracy etc. Most important, it is an India that is ruled by *democratically elected people*! Assassinating an elected leader is as good as executing a portion of the electorate. So does the film suggest that we should condone mass murder? The parallels between the British Raj and modern day corruption, and those between hot-headed brainless youngsters and the thoughtful revolutionaries of the freedom movement were shameful - the British were not elected by us - they were an imperialistic power from a different country. Violence may well have been the only resort (though therein lies a healthy debate - there were many thousands who believed that there were other ways to bring about change).If we do not like the politicians we elect, the rational course of action should be ""don't vote for them"", not ""let's kill them"". It is amazing that such a movie can be made in the same country that produced Mahatma Gandhi. It is also sad that it took a British filmmaker to make that film and an Indian film maker to make this one.Having said that, the movie was interesting because it raised questions that have not been raised in mainstream Hindi movies. Unfortunately it answered them as well, and incorrectly, and simplistically, IMO. The positive reaction that RDB has received so far is far from funny - it is downright worrisome. Modern Indian youth seems to think in unison that boys in the story are to be glorified and congratulated for what they did. Even the supposedly sophisticated Manhattan audience with whom I shared the screening started clapping at the end of the movie. I was quite nauseated, and dismayed.I came out of the movie quite angry, and raved and ranted at my wife for a while re. the moral center of the movie. By the time I reached home I had calmed down, and realized that if a movie was able to create a evoke such strong emotion (even if a negative one) then something must be said of the film and the filmmaker.Morality apart, the movie has huge holes in the plot, which has been written about in these pages.",1
Rang De Basanti,"Rang DE.. turned out to be as colorful as its name with shades of reckless youth to the maturity of the subject it wishes to project. The comparisons drawn between past and present and the way the characters really emerge out has been the high point of the movie.Aamir khan looks more mature than a college pass out but then he makes up with his fine performance and instinctive manipulation. It is a patriotic movie and relates well to the younger generation.I would definitely rate Alice's performance among one of the best and how she's so much comfortable with Hindi is amazing.It is an irony in the film that it took a foreign girl to make the youth realize of their patriotic heritage. Music of the movie is awesome and suits the mood with romantic numbers like' Tu bin bat-aye',to the hip op 'pathshala' and finally to the highly emotive""Lukka Ch.."".The picturisation of songs is great. The director has used the characters very intelligently working on their strengths and also the depiction of political characters is commendable .The best aspect of the movie is the editing and screenplay, although I feel a better job could have been done with the dialogs. All in all it is a great must see movie..",4
Rang De Basanti,"In continuation of Indian Cinema's new found interest in dishing out sensible stuff, Rang De Basanti is a runaway winner in terms of acting, direction, screenplay..you name it, and of course MESSAGE. The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth, but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption, and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost taken-for-granted independence. Also, the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camera-work is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabi-style wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi, however, is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all, a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10!",5
Rang De Basanti,"Now all of us should commend RdB for the bold initiative in putting forth the idea of what the common citizen of India would like to do to every..cough...democratically elected...cough...politician. The movie was quite influential to the point that the political scum really need to worry about their safety. Having said all that, there is really nothing in this movie itself besides that which is worth mentioning. Its the standard Bollywood fare of singing, dancing, religion related fighting and a look at the past freedom struggle from the British. All that changes when one of the friends gets killed in an air crash, attributed to low quality spares approved by corrupt politicians. The heroes thus go and kill a politician in broad daylight. The obvious happens and they are hunted down and killed by counter terrorist squads. The end.",3
Rang De Basanti,"This movie is like watching a 20 round boxing match expecting to see an epic knockout, only to see two dancing queens prancing around the ring when finally in the 15th round you get a knockdown. You get all excited, finally something, this must be where it gets good. Only to watch em Pasa Doble into to the 20th round. No'one else mentions this, as if they didn't notice, but this movie is over three hours long. I promise you, you WILL spend well over the first half of that wondering why all the rave. The best part about this movie is the hilariously ridiculous ""western"" music they dance to. After watching this movie I felt incredibly far removed from Indian culture. One of the main characters wears jean jackets, and fingerless gloves! Think Fonzie, but less cool, and not a caricature. Indians, direct people away from this movie, cause I seriously felt embarrassed for you as I watched it.",1
Rang De Basanti,"The first half of the movie was promising out to be a 5 on 10, but then they started the second half which brings it down to the bottom floor :( There's attempt at good movie-making , but obviously they have succeeded in making good money. I admire the business acumen of the movie makers to put in a little this and a little that to pull in most importantly the rich crowds - the Punjabis in India and abroad. Secondly, it uses some cutting-edge techniques to make the movie LOOK good to critics in India who are mainly exposed to trash after mindless song-dance trash for review. This is the only reason I can think for this movie to get rave reviews. And then , there are ALSO those BIG HIT dance numbers which the yuppy crowd goes into see picturized on the big screen. But does a soundtrack make a movie good ?!! Once the audience are in , the movie preaches and preaches and preaches. Then it preaches AGAIN !I don't mind the above mentioned tricks 'coz the movie makers want to make money firstly , and hats off to them for succeeding . However , strickly speaking about the movie's quality , it has problems.Today's India is building itself on its IT and economic policies and capitalism , but this movie preaches about how the youth today should adopt violence against the establishment to make the country move ahead. This movie ( and others coming out of India ) glorifies Bhagat Singh etc. a bit too much. There have been some classics about him in the distant past , but the movie industry seems to inclined to portray these guys as the ones who actually brought freedom to India. Well ... like Mahatma Gandhiji did not exist , Or the World War did not create problems for British enough for them to start pulling out of most countries . A biographic movie about Bhagat Singh etc. would've been tolerable, but this movie PREACHES that the techniques of Singh and Azad are SO EFFECTIVE that they can be successful in today's world. I have doubts about that.Well , Youth of India ,thankfully you don't have the guts to practice the lessons from this movie. However if you DO , please don't! India is progressing fine, thank you. In fact, India can do with a little lesser crime.Other irritants abound in this movie. One I can think of right now was the evil corrupt and mean politician with an IQ of bird-droppings. Now ... politicians anywhere might be mean , evil and corrupt , but they're generally among the smartest people on earth. But this one was so dumb that he actually criticizes a dead pilot! Not surprisingly , people were not pleased with him.The list of unbelievable irritants can go on , so I'll end with one last thing about this movie which which is WRONG - it leads u to think Punjab is the only place in India !But hey ,the movie has the regular masalas for a block-buster - Romance , loud music and violence. Add to that a lot of patriotic hoohaa. Then there's Hindu-Muslim solidarity. So , keep your intellect aside and you might enjoy the movie.",1

Jumanji 3,"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!",5
Jumanji 3,"I just used to love ""Jumanji"" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy ""Jumanji"". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10",4
Jumanji 3,"Find a comfortable chair, lay out the board, grab the dice, and get ready to play.  But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away.In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.",5
Jumanji 3,"There is only one way to describe Jumanji: excellent. The plot is very, original, with outstanding concepts packed into each individual scene. After viewing this movie, the wild side of the jungle gets into you, making you want to dare to play the game. Although the computer animation may not look all that real, I still give this movie a 10/10, for an outstanding plot, casting, and spirit, which any great movie has.",5
Jumanji 3,"I remember I watched this movie a few years back. I always wanted to see the movie again, and I finally did that today. Strange that this movie has alway been on top of my mind...This movie is amazing! It has everything; comedy, love, adventure.Shortly after the movie started, your mind will be sucked into the story.Great!10 out of 10 from me!",5
Jumanji 3,"You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from ""Jumanji"", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.",4
Jumanji 3,"This is the kind of movie that i would still like to watch even after 23 years, its unpredictable , you'll never know what to expect, ending was not what i expected it could have been a bit more exciting , but overall still a classic",5
Jumanji 3,"This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!",5
Jumanji 3,"In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. ""Jumanji"" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jumanji""",4
Jumanji 3,"I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.",5
Jumanji 3,"I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and ""Jumanji"" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.",5
Jumanji 3,"Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off.This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children.All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania.Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.",5
Jumanji 3,I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.,4
Jumanji 3,"One of the best 90's child's movie. Includes adventure, humor and love.
The plot heightens the intensity of the jungle by bringing a board game to actual life, with really good special effects for a 90's film.
Robin Williams is amazing as always and his role also symbolizes the struggling bond between father and son and overcoming fear.
I'm thrilled that my kids loved the movie the same way i did when I was in their age.",5
Jumanji 3,I really enjoy this film. The only reason that I gave it 9 stars instead of ten was because it slightly scared me and I'm not a huge fan of that. Regardless it's a great film with amazing actors and wonderful message. Makes me miss Robin a lot!,5
Jumanji 3,"This movie took me back to my childhood, fortunately for me, my journey was not cumber sum as Alan's. the movie reminded me of the fun we had watching the movie with our cousin and enjoying the fantasy of a magical board game. the movie also made me realise that what a marvellous actor Robin Williams was. it saddened me that a person who spread happiness could come to an unfortunate end.",5
Jumanji 3,"Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid.With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him.Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him.What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film.Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.",5
Jumanji 3,"Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game.'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!",5
Jumanji 3,"I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley.I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it!",5
Jumanji 3,"Another of my favorite childhood movies, there is Jumanji,one of my favorite movies with Robin Willians and Kirsten Dunst. Alan Parrish is a rich boy and his family were the founders of the city of New England, where the boy and his family lives. Not only that, his father is a businessman who has lots of deals and one of them is the notable shoe factory. But Alan life is not so good as we think: he is having problems with her best friend Sarah's boyfriend and his gang and his father wants to send him to a boarding school. Angry, he says to his father that he is never going to talk to him again and will ran away from his home. But when Alan was going to scape from his house, his friend Sarah goes to his house to talk, and they end up playing the mysterious game called Jumanji that Alan found buried. The strange game starts, and many strange things like wild animals start to show up, until Alan enter the game and be confined there until the results of the dice be 5 or 8. Sarah, too afraid to continue playing,run away. After 26 years,two brothers named Judy and Peter found the game and start playing it, like Sarah and Alan 26 years ago. Peter takes 5 in the dice, what makes Alan turn back after many years. Now they need to finish the game in order to all the horrible results end, but first Alan needs to find Sarah and convince her to play the spooky game again.",4
Jumanji 3,"Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. ""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5.

Natpe Thunai,As usual sports dram film ... Amateur acting ... Pridictable story ... You want to waste your time ... Just go with it,2
Natpe Thunai,"Nice entertainer to watch.
Appreciating team for choosing national sport to film the drama..
Overall,Natpe thunai, a complete combo of politics and sports.",3
Natpe Thunai,"Below review is completely based on my opinion and film knowledge.Commerical film - that's okay. But where's the entertainment?? Aadhi is going below par (considering his music and his new venture - acting & direction). This Film has all the old commercial stuff that you have seen so far in Tamil cinema. Nothing new.Bad film cast.
Bad acting.
Usual story.
Music is okay.
Bad direction.Positives to take from the movie is 'Vijay (Eruma Saani fame )' acting. Gave some good laughters to the audience.This film completely indented for making profit.I don't understand, using some good looking girls and showing them inappropriate in songs. Will that enough for you guys. Such a crap. Marketing strategy.I regret for those 3 hours.Believe me, this is not at all entertaining.This team is new & young - they should really provide quality stuff. There are more passionate, talented directors out there struggling for opportunities. One should properly utilize these kinda opportunity. I would say.",1
Natpe Thunai,"The story is about a hockey team, that has to win a tournament to keep the ground. if they don't they loose it. and as expected they win. There is no actual story, neither it is a comedy. it is 2 hours of my life that I wasted.",1
Natpe Thunai,"Miserably poor acting (except for the villain), lots of silly overacting... Overloaded with loud, racous, forgettable songs... Poor meandering plot, with no clear direction... Dozens of political and social punchless dialogues for the average audience to whistle for... The actual hockey scenes were the only decent scenes... Makes the typical masala flick look legendary...",1
Natpe Thunai,One of the must watch Sport Entertainer with Real Time Politics(Sports Politics)A very common starting with Fun & Love and slowly gearing up with Sports Politics. Till interval the Plot focused on Hero & His Love and First Half end up with movie's main plot Intro.Interval Block is Amazing. And there itself story gearing up with Top Speed... And Predictable movie end but still engage the Audience with the plot. Just like Director Sundar.C style(Producer of the Movie).Team's work is really good in Hockey Game's detailing in the movie and Technically very strong in Camera which is a must required thing in a sports genre.Music - Songs are good and BGM is Theri MASS!!! Hiphop Tamizha Aadhi proved once again!!!Logical Mistakes are there but Screenplay is not letting the Audience to focus on that.Also the Movie (In)directly spoke many about Tamilnadu's politics and end up with the Question on Audience.One Line about movie: Simply Superb... Congratulations Aadhi & Team!!!,4
Natpe Thunai,"Both the hockey match sequences were the edge of the seat entertainers, fantastic work was done in that part.Poor performance by almost all the actors, none of the scenes came lively.
Although BGM elevates some parts of the movie, the overall Musical taste felt unfulfilled.
Karu Palaniappan's role was just fabulous and portrayed most of the today's politician's face.
Wondering why Aadhi would waste his skills as his musical career seems to be better than his acting skills in which he's showing no progress at all.",3
Natpe Thunai,Such an extraordinary intermission block at an un expected moment . Created goosebumps,5
Natpe Thunai,"Film was really good. It was fast and had a very unique story. Usually these types of stories are really common amongst all Tamil movies, the thing that made unique was the way they presented it and how they presented it. The intermission block was awesome and really nice, it almost gave goosebumps. The music was also exceptionally good. Overall this is a really great film, this review is unbiased. Please spend your time and watch this movie with your family, it's worth it.
No one payed me any money for this good review. The movie is actually that good.",5
Natpe Thunai,Please appreciate movies like this. Tamils will really love this. I dont know about other state people.,5
Natpe Thunai,Expect the unexpected....Meendum oru murai meesaiyai murukki ullar HHT Aadhi,5
Natpe Thunai,"Adhi action nyc , overall movie is based on hockey....
""Here lost his friend that's really emotional""Climax scene comedy entertainment.",3
Super Deluxe,"#SuperDeluxe - This is a strict A film. Not like IAMK type but something that is very new to tamil cinema. The film is so dark because these characters are so real and it's like meeting someone you'll never meet in ordinary life. Director #ThiagarajanKumararaja, he deserves a standing ovation for writing this masterpiece, the screenplay is a high point. Maybe he'll be Kollywood's best known Screen writer.The background set, Cinematography is all just so perfect. No compromises made anywhere.Coming on to #Samantha, she made a terrific role. Her second lifetime best role, first is always Nithya from #NEP. #VijaySethupathy has nothing to prove here, we already know what he is. #FahadhFaasil, #Bucks, #Mysskin, small boy, 5 youngesters all gave a wonderful performance.Overall, I would give Super Deluxe an Oscar if I was part of Jury for it's unconventional story line, something we have never seen in Tamil Cinema. The low point is, it won't work with all of the Tamil audiences. I have a friend who diagrees with all my points and says that 'Super Deluxe' has too many unclutural, uncomfortable scenes or dialogs involved. The problem is that the film is way ahead of our time.But in the end of the day, a film should either be Art or Entertainment. This is Artainment. This is new, this is very new with Tamil Cinema. I enjoyed every frame of this masterpiece. I cannot guarantee you the same, it depends on how you react when your best friend breaks your brand new TV for seeing something awful in it. So, go and experience this yourself.",5
Super Deluxe,"Thiagarajan Kumararaja has conveyed and compiled so many messages as much as possible in a movie. I am sure the might have forced to have omitted few messages due to the length of the movie.How do you feel when you have something to say to the world and it displayed in the form of a movie, it was such a kind of a movie.It is not easy to direct such movies without the influence of a higher intellectual.It is high time people change their perception and start accepting realities in life.Life is very simple, we spoil it because of our very own thoughts and deeds.This movie is to all those who have the ability to perceive and be receptive to adapt a new life. You realise life, because you are alive !!!",5
Super Deluxe,Never seen this kind of movie. This movie will touch every Genre of movie style.,5
Super Deluxe,"Masterpiece would be the perfect word to describe this cult movie. It holds you with curiosity until the last-minute and creates a great impact. All actors have played their part so well that they stay in our mind as characters of the film. Vijay sethupathi as Shilpa, he has given an extraordinary performance as usual. Samantha as Vembu proves that she is a star performer. The end voice over philosophy creates a greater impact and connects all the important dialogues in the movie which points to message that the director tries to conveys to the audience. Thiagarajan Kumararaja deserves National Award! Close to 3 hours movie without songs must watch guys!",5
Super Deluxe,"Yet again thiagarajan kumaraja proved he is king in story telling. Starting from story, props, visual, BGM and every actor role were apt and movie is definitely worth watch for more than once !",5
Super Deluxe,"The movie sets the ball rolling big time even as the credits come on. Then the background music makes it's entry and then the first scene comes on, and you know, you are in the right theater.The deep saturated colors in the frames feel so perfect. The frames are simply perfect - framing characters in different portions of the screen, amazing.There are so many scenes that are so hilarious. The screenplay has a welcome randomness to it. You typically never know what is coming.Vijay Sethupathi is on a push-the-envelope mode. While the old man in Aadhi was challenging, the transgender in Super-Deluxe is a level up in challenge and well met.Fahad Fazil, on the other hand, did not have a better role here than say ""Kumbalangi Nights"". Some of his scenes almost did not work, while many others did.Bagavathi Perumal, who plays the subinspector has given a truly outstanding performance, potentially surpassed only by Vijay Sethupathi, who had the advantage of much more challenging scenes.Yuvan Shankar Raja has done amazing background music work, that stands out with it's subduedness. Music is used to enhance comedy at multiple points, and the result has been fantastic. Also, unique sound choices to communicate scene tension, background sounds to give a feel of a lot of background action.Multiple unpredictable random threads of stories sometimes come together in such a sudden tight knot that you can almost touch. Randomness is just awesome.The thread on god did not connect with me and hence, scenes on that thread, felt like a drag, as also did some scenes of Fahadh.Deeply philosophical as well, the movie presents various valid stands. I did not quite like the ending as much, as it was a bit preachy. On the other hand, leaving it abstract might not communicate enough.A must watch and more. Worthy of multiple watches for sure.",5
Super Deluxe,"If you are expecting tamil cinema to reach its highest limits, watch this movie and you will definitely find the tamil industry already reached beyond its limits. It is a pure and raw form of tamil film. I don't think anyone can cross this limits in future except Thiyagraja. perfect screenplay and script work. he deserves more than a national award for making such an exotdinary film. He shifted the whole industry to the next level with his unique and raw style. Completely satisfied.",5
Super Deluxe,Just get into Kumararaja's world..take the ride.. and get the experience..,4
Super Deluxe,"No doubt Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe is one of the masterpiece and the cult classic film in Tamil. The moment I saw the posters of Park Chan-wook's Sympathy for Vengeance, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and a picture of David Lynch at the DVD Rental store in the film, I was sold, that's when I thought this is going to be full paisa vasool padam. You're getting a full package of four Film (since it has four different story) wrapped and served on a platter.In one of the interview Thiagarajan Kumararaja said he's afraid to write and he's lazy. Seriously...? When he can create wonders like Aaranya Kaandam and Super Deluxe when he's afraid and lazy, just wonder what would be the outcome if he's not lazy or afraid.Take a bow to the writers - Kumararaja, Mysskin, Nalan Kumarasamy and Neelan K. Sekhar for crafting such a phenomenal story across their views on life, relationships, love, sex and spirituality. And an extra effort made by Kumararaja to hyperlink those stories along With Idiosyncratic and Palpable characters.Samantha as Vaembu, is one heck of a performance. For the fact, she wasn't the first choice for the character, many leading actresses had turned down playing Vaembu. And now I can say, no one else could have done it better than Sam, she's irreplaceable.And our very own Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi playing the transgender women Shilpa, the episodes between him and his son Rasukutty (Ashwanth Ashokkumar) Was so pure, for sure you will fall in love with that kid. Bagavathi Perumal as SI Berlin is one character where the audience will feel like thrashing him, Shilpa-Berlin and Vaembu-Berlin scenes, will definitely fill the rage in the eyes of the audience for its own reasons. Leela's (Ramya Krishnan) dialogue towards the end of the climax, will definitely hit you hard.Fahadh Faasil as Mugilan, Mysskin as Arputham, Gayathrie as Jyothi and the four kids. You will witness some awe-inspiring performance by each and everyone, proving their caliber. Even the minor characters, has done some stupendous job in acting.Once you understand Kumararaja, the same lengthy and boring scenes will now slowly transit to an interesting setting. Vinod and Nirav Shah cinematography elevates the story, the color pattern, the unconventional camera angles, along with the crisp editing by Sathyaraj Natarajan, I was spellbound.If you've already validated 'Rowdy Baby' as Yuvan Shankar Raja best in career in terms of its quality treatment and popularity, then you must Watch Super Deluxe. As they say, there's something more than that meets the eye, U1 's sound design techniques is one among that. Every minute detail that you witness in his background scoring along with Illaiyaraja songs, is something which can be considered as the added bonus to your paisa vasool ticket. And the ride ends with the compelling climax.If one can even enjoy the steady frame for more than 8 seconds and the silence within that. Then it has to be Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Film.",4
Super Deluxe,"Out of the world , no words to describe , this movie will definitely discover a completely new term/genre.Only a person who breathes cinema can create this. amazing actors , performances , and gripping scenes , fabulous screenplay proving all film directors and cinematographers that screenplay can also be made this way.Perfect details , shots , every shot makes us travel through the journey of the characters in the film , that intense , the choice of shots would be very normal but details in each of the shots conveyed a lot of stories establishing the connect and reality .Treat for cinema lovers!!",5
Super Deluxe,The Complete Unit deserves an Applaud. I would not mind watching it again and again.,5
Super Deluxe,The movie revolves around many character but the beauty is that we can connect to all ... Music is a Bonus to the film..... Each actor as eaten each other by their acting ...simply and admirable cinematography ...... Deals with many problems and a most wanted message ......,5
Super Deluxe,"Everything that happens around us can be law of causation or absolute miracle. It depends on that individual's conscience and perspective. This movie is about a dozen of such characters with absolutely varied levels of understanding and approach towards life and the people around them. Series of events that happens to them and how they react to it.Movie is filled with unexpected circumstances, honest and innocent reactions, and deep thoughts cracked very lightly. At several places, director mocks at us (the society) while making us laugh at our own stupidity, tolerance-to-injustice, misaligned-priorities, overseeing the obvious and several other essential aspects of co-existence.People with conservative mindset will not be able to ingest the fact that ""When the wife confesses she just slept with someone; the husband, though angry, takes it pretty lightly"". Understandable. But it is an undeniable fact that the women of their household too, must have at-least fantasized about someone else and their chastity is mostly circumstantial.It is for intelligent minds interested in researching and seeking amendments in social science and soul searching. If you are tired day-in-day-out crunching numbers, logics and dealing with other's insecurities and wanted to break-free with a rom-com (romantic-comedy), please stay far away from it. :)",5
Super Deluxe,"Am not going to tell you to watch this movie..
But do watch this movie for different experience..",4
Super Deluxe,"A must watch movie in recent days. What a movie making man. Cinematography is another level; Every shot is like a painting; Camera angles are highly innovative. The background score is equally well made. Hats off to the whole team, you nailed it!",5
Super Deluxe,"Multiple different stories, messages, narrations at times can drag the movie way more than required and kind of becomes pointless at times. Its good in ""many"" aspects, but that ""many"" aspects kind of could have been few and made equal impact. Though really kudos to all actors and Director to bring a great movie.",4
Super Deluxe,"Never have I seen a portrayal of social stigmas in a commercial movie. Great effort by the director in his second movie. UFO, Sex change, Adultery, power plays, beliefs, youth exploitation, you name it... Lucidly portrayed with a star cast brave enough to rough it out and perform so naturally.",5
Super Deluxe,I hope this film will reach to every people in the world. I have never 'EXPERIENCED' this kind of a Drama. What You need? They have everything you need. Background score is amazing by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Each and everyone's acting is tooo good. This film is a totally hard-hitting Masterpiece I have never seen so far.,5
Super Deluxe,"A movie that causes you to continuously analyze every single event and figure out the importance of it definitely has to be Super Deluxe. With 3 narratives that are showed simultaneously telling amazing stories that are somehow interlinked. Super deluxe also includes many amazing performances from all cast members and also has many confusing moments that will make you think. Kumararaja believes his audience is intelligent by making such a complex movie for his viewers. This is definitely a must watch film and is revolutionary movie for Tamil cinema.Spoiler
Alien explanation:
Based on the overall message of the movie, it seems that the inclusion of the alien scene was to convey that all people are not unique since society fears the people that are different. The alien states that her former best friend has died 2 minutes earlier but she didn't shed a tear because she was able to find a replacement that was the same since everyone on earth is unique. This ties in well with the story since Shilpa says to her son that don't be unique because society will reject you.",5
Super Deluxe,"Anybody who is into any form of self enquiry, whether it pertains to the traditional system of Yoga or the newly and infinitely synthesized ways from the mind would resonate deeply with this film. Hats off and a standing ovation to each and every person who made this film possible. I am definitely getting a blue ray physical copy and preserving it for life.",5
Super Deluxe,People will begin understand that there is nothing right or wrong in this world. It is just perfect the way it is and the way it is going.,5
Super Deluxe,Tamil movie industry is definitely in good form. Coming up with bold and beautiful films. Super deluxe is another amazing movie from the industry. I would have give 9 star but the director dragged many scenes and made it in to a 3 hours and I don't know why. There are many scenes you will feel bored. Yet a film you should go and watch in theater for its beautiful images. Director used mostly Dark blue and red and it was amazing.,3
Super Deluxe,Once in a lifetime time kind movie. Best ever expirence. All are equal concept. Enjoyed a lot,5
Lucifer ,#SaveLucifer #PickUpLuciferOne of the best shows around. It deserves to continue right where it left off.,5
Lucifer ,As we all know by now FOX cancelled LUCIFER. I love that show. I hope and pray another network picks up LUCIFER. I think the best network to pick up LUCIFER is the CW. LUCIFER would fit right in the CW wheelhouse along with SUPERNATURAl and all the other shows like that the CW has. FOX which always cancels anything really good that people really like cancelled LUCIFER while leaving one hell of a cliffhanger.,5
Lucifer ,"Unfortunately I found out yesterday that Lucifer has been cancelled. As light hearted shows go it was a winner, the whole cast went for it and did a great job. Lucy, Maze, Douche, Amenadiel, and Linda were flawless in their roles. Perhaps Chloe could have removed the big wooden pole from her backside a bit more often but hey, she looked good. Its strange how good shows like this get chopped and absolute rubbish like IZombie keeps getting renewed and its really really rubbish.",5
Lucifer ,"How can you cancel the greatest show ever. In a world full of crap this was the only show that made me happy to watch. And Season 3 episode 24 was amazing. I am praying for being renewed. I am pretty sure that for so much money you can make up with good ideas. I understand that from now on it will be hard, but don't do the same as The Sicret Circle! Please! I give the show 10 out of 10!",5
Lucifer ,Are you kidding me! Why would they do. The show is great. They keep renewing these other shows that stinkLook at Timeless they canceled and the fans were outraged and they brought it back,5
Lucifer ,Lucifer is one of the best & most original show on TV. Please have another network pick it up. I will truly miss this show. I can't believe it was cancelled. What a shame. So much garbage out there & this gets cancelled. PLEASE BRING IT BACK.,5
Lucifer ,I can't believe this show has been cancelled already. It was FUNNY and WELL written.... although there were times I wish they'd hire more writers for this show because I loved the banter between Lucifer and the Detective (Chloe) that really showed us Lucifer wasn't as GOOD as he seemed.I loved that it seemed to follow some religious dogma and never lampooned it.Unfortunately this cancellation smells of Network giving in to the early protest by religious groups. If ONLY they had watched it... None of it made fun of religion or any one's beliefs!I am going to miss this show... I've watched hoping there'd be some reruns - I could watch this show So many times more!,5
Lucifer ,"I have liked this show from the beginning. Tom Ellis is perfect as the devil, and does an excellent job. The show has a lot to challenge the traditional; handsome, suave devil over an ugly one with horns. I love the line where he says something like, I'm tired of everyone blaming me for what they do, I didn't MAKE them do anything. There is a lot of truth delivered thru sophisticated humor and debonair acting. The Pierce/Cain story with Luci is intense at times, and you wonder if Cain will ever get the truth of how his curse will disappear. Note: just watched ep 20, he does. So...I love this show & want it to continue. Nielsen needs to fix their @*^&( rating system - I, & many like me, DO NOT WATCH TV - we watch whatever, whenever on the computer.",5
Lucifer ,This has been one of our favorite shows on Monday nights! The season3 finale cannot be the series finale. Too many questions and answers given and need to know what's next! Tom Ellis is excellent as Lucifer.,5
Lucifer ,"Lucifer is s show like no others.
It is drama, procedural, comedy, fantasy.
It 's full of funny lines and references to other shows/songs/movies
You have to be smart to keep up. 
The cast is awesome, Tom Ellis on top .
After 3 seasons, it was unexpectedly cancelled by Fox, leaving us wuth a huge cliffhanger and so many points to be covered.
The massive campaign #savelucifer #PickUpLucifer is sustaining the return of the show for a darker, powerful and supernatural season. 
 We hope to succeed to have our Devil back .
We deserve it",5
Lucifer ,"Great writing, excellent acting. Fun and unexpected, Lucifer has everything you need in a show.It was very sad and disappointing that the show was cancelled after just 3 seasons, there was certainly much more to offer the fans.I hope another network picks it.",5
Lucifer ,Hopefully this enjoyable show will be picked up by another network soon.,5
Lucifer ,"No doubt,It deserves to continue.It's fun,different,loved it.I see no reason to cancel.",5
Lucifer ,"You've got to be kidding me! This was one of the best shows on TV. I was even able to get some of my religious friends to watch it, and they found out their judgments were wrong!Tom Ellis is the best! He's handsome and funny as hell (pun intended) with LOL moments. I love the way he takes vanity to its highest level.Come on Fox network! Listen to the people who 'religiously ' LOL watch this show! Let us have some fun on a Monday night, after Sunday church. It's down right criminal to take this show off the air! Who are the executives who made this decision? Fire their asses! They are like stupid is as stupid does. Only way to solve the problem of bad timing for canceling a great show. You know what? I'm done with Fox! Won't be watching any of their shows. Waste of time, time I will never get back in life!",5
Lucifer ,"This show IS AWESOME!! This is one of the few network shows I have continued to watch. There must be a cable channel or Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon team willing to keep it alive. To be honest, ready to cancel one or two of the three aforementioned services do to lack of quality programming - and lack of quality movies. I would definitely continue to pay for a service that kept this series alive!",5
Lucifer ,"Exceptional writing, acting and character development! This series ended on a cliffhanger and Netflix needs to pick it up!",5
Lucifer ,"Lucifer is the best show that I have seen in a very long time. It has a perfect balance between humour and drama. From the description it may seem as just another cop show with a twist, but it is so much more. The true power of the show lies in the way it treats the characters. Never before have I seen a show that pays so much attention to character development. And it is not just the two main characters Lucifer & Chloe that grow througout the series, but also the other characters.The combination of the love that the creators have for all the characters with excellent storylines and dialogue sets this show apart from all others. This and the truly stellar acting makes that it absolutely deserves more seasons.",5
Lucifer ,"Please I've read the moans petitions about how this glorifies Satan.. Sorry but so does Supernatural. Why do people in the US take this stuff so seriously. It a send up OK? Lucifer is witty and charming with fabulous one liners. The plot is terrible. (So are many of Supernaturals... Sorry guys) but we don't watch it for that.. if we believed every series on TV. I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat ""Cos Aliens are here"" Back to the Pilot.... Our British lead Tom Ellis was all suave and smooth like a very old Brandy. Whilst Lauren German was a little Ditsy but his nemesis, but in truth sexy and funny. A future partner in crime.With myself and a few hundred UK Facebook friends we can't wait for the next episode. Please.. those petitioners who wanted this banned. have you seen it? Did it make you at least chuckle? Still Nope here's a secret, Aliens have landed!",5
Lucifer ,"This show is one of the best shows I've ever seen (and I have seen a LOT of shows). It has an incredible cast, it has a perfect balance of being hilarious and serious. With the exception of the s1 and s3 villain, you just can't help but fall in love with every character. After that season 3 finale, WE NEED MORE LUCIFER!! Despite not having proper promotion (or merchandise!) by the network, this show has managed to build a global fanbase PURELY because of how excellent it is. I have never been this passionate about a show before, and whomever picks it up is set to gain MILLIONS of customers all (impatiently) waiting to flock to any new place our wonderful Devil goes. :)",5
Lucifer ,"SPOILER: So FOX cancelled Lucifer without a reason. Now the whole world is trying to save it with #savelucifer #renewlucifer #pickuplucifer. But after seeing this season finale... i'm SHOCKED! This badass ending was a hell of a cliff hanger! And what does FOX do, agian they cancel a good show. WHAT THE HELL FOX??And nobody is saying it, but i think it's about the ""glorifying the devil"" issues, but whores and drugs on tv are no problem....? Thinking those faithfull people need to stick with fithing the real issues out there, on the streets.",5
Lucifer ,"I heard the news that FOX is cancelling Lucifer... I just dont get it, A show with rating 8,2 on IMDB with over 100k votes, what is lately rare, and then PUFF! Lets cancel it... I do not know what was the way of thinking of the person behind this and i just cant figured it out.
But i guess another reality show is coming or another crap like that...
Maybe Netflix or HBO will pick it up as they do know how to make a good TV Series work,",5
Lucifer ,"I don't understand why this show got canceled! I've watched so many crime/drama/fantasy series, and none quite like this! The devil himself on a path to salvation, and the magical romance between Decker and Lucifer is even better than watching Booth and Brennan! This show has so many layers and so much potential! Someone pick up this show! Things can't end like this now that Decker finally knows his secret!!!",5
Lucifer ,One of the best shows I have ever seen. Alot of times it helped me to get through the rough days and also helped me understand alot of emotions because I could've relate to the shown emotions on it and feel like someone is always there for me when I need it the most. So I really 't believe it's getting canceled. I hope this decission will change.,5
Lucifer ,"Losing the red horn and pitchfork for debonair skin, the titular entity roams our world with wealth and taste. Lucifer is a quirky, somewhat mischievous take on the fallen angel. It has many pop references, cool soundtracks and more importantly, a smooth convincing acting from the lead actor Tom Ellis.Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious.Production has all sort of nifty flair. Visual utilizes light tone, it gives more cinematic feel than most series, probably to portray the larger than life persona. Soundtracks are very good, the music is a mix of pop, rock and rap, which will resonate with audience in youthful fashion.Characters are pretty inviting, and it's not just about Lucifer himself. Supporting roles play good parts too, the female police looks sympathetic enough for long term strange partnership, almost in odd buddy cop gimmick. It leaves many possibilities for future episodes, maybe it ventures into case of the week or just expanding on how manipulative Lucifer can be without becoming too sinister for silver screen.Not sure how long Lucifer will walk the TV or how he will maintain the nature of the series in the long run, but as far as introduction goes, it is done with great taste. Fascinatingly classy and with a touch of devilry, please give Lucifer the courtesy of your viewing.",4
Lucifer ,"I bloody love this show,the acting is superb,the cast is bloody fantastic,the characters are brilliant. I don't know why people complain about this TV Series so much,yes its about the devil/fallen angel but there ain't anything evil about this TV show,its just a show full of heart,action and humor,it really doesn't take itself to seriously. This show is better than the other crap on the CW channel. 
The show's lead Tom Ellis is very talented,he can sing and act,his acting is the best I've seen in years,he is bloody funny. Lucifer and Dectective Decker are the best crime fighting duo I've seen since Castle's Kate Beckette and Richard Castle. The chemistry between these two characters is just burning hot. The rest of the cast and characters is just brilliant. Overall this show is amazing,and it carrys a message ""anyone can be redeemed"" the show is all about redemption and it might sound crazy the devil getting redemption but it is only TV fiction. You just have to look past the title and the fact its about the devil,and just sit back and enjoy the show. Spoiler: Lucifer got his angel wings back and he lost his devil face,he literally has been forgiven by God.",5
Athiran,I would say that it may be an exact copy of movie named 'Stoneheartst Asylum'.But the making and cinematography was perfect.Sai Palavi done her character as it max...There is still lacking something in this film may be the characters rather than fahad and sai palavi were flawless...Anyway a good experimental movie in malayalam in recent time..one time watchable.....,4
Athiran,The movie has many good spots the diriction is absolutley super and acting fahad and sai were massive and the suspence is preditable but not much good thriller the climax was the father of varathan on the basis of the flow of the movie this is a horror feel phycoligical thriller ..,4
Athiran,"Different concept..good..
All credits are goes to saipallavi and Fahad and Vivek team..
Feeling happy...",5
Athiran,"Really good movie with new theme. Fahad comes to a mental hospital for an inspection about malpratices and treatments going on there.
Its a horror suspense thriller we cant even guess the story . Go and watch its a nice film.",5
Athiran,"It's an amazing film with brilliant direction, acting, casting, thrils. It will take you to the next level. It's milestone of malayalam cinema",5
Athiran,"First of all the acting artists selected for the film were apt and suitable for their characters. Fahad is excellent as usual, the others made the film to an extraordinary pysco thriller.Sai Pallavi played a great role in this film, and I recognize this character is the best she ever acted in the malayalam film making. By saying the best supportive actor I recommend Mr. Renji Panicker for his talented skills throughout the film...
Good direction, much better script, apt cameraman, specially the actors and actresses made the film amazing...Thanks for the day..",5
Athiran,"Go watch ""9"" instead.
With so much talent at your disposal all you could do was to pick up 12 scenes from different psychological thrillers and piece it together in one? Is this the best you can do?
Editing is one of the worst I have ever scene.
The only saving grace are the setting and Sai's performance.
Save your money and go watch Prithviraj's ""9"". It has a much better premise and far more well thought out in its execution.",2
Athiran,"I won't suggest this movie to all those who have seen ""9"" and ""Shutter Island"" , they might feel this movie a bit cliche because the film follows a similar pattern . Apart from that it's all good , especially the sound it has to be experienced in cinema and it's stunning visuals .",4
Athiran,The actors especially Sai Pallavi showed great spirit. The movie plot was good yet predictable . It is a fabulous movie to watch .,5
Athiran,"At the beginning, it was kind of similar to Shutter Island. But as the story progresses, I was proved wrong . The first half contains jump scares and loud sound effects. The second half is the crux of the story and not many scary stuffs. The setting was great , in fact it managed to give off spooky and eerie vibes .
Coming to the acting , Sai Pallavi was brilliant. Fahad as usual was great . Other supporting characters were amazing . A very small star cast which was able to create an impact . The only negative part was the romantic song in between the progression. But once we watch the climax , the song would actually make sense . The climax was amazing. Not very predictable though. Do watch this in the cinemas to get the actual experience.",4
Athiran,"Let's just say it could have been a little less dramatic. Atul Kulkarni, usually intense was more like an over actor. Probably the director could have controlled this. Fahadh also was a bit over the top, but only occasionally. Sai Pallavi, I thought, did her part very well. Acting quality was overall on the average.The story is GOOD, but skirting the average. Please view it from a 'dark movie', angle so expectations of a feel good factor are futile and unfair. Over usage of unnecessary screams and loud bangs is a big big turn off. They could also have done away with scenes which look copied. The jailed woman idea are a straight lift from SI. The director surely seems to have been an SI fan as the asylum's theme and locations are very similar looking minus the sea.Overall its a decent one time watch with a racy and thrilling end which unfolds with Prakash Raj's late entry and a very short cameo.",3
Athiran,"Fahad, and Sai Pallavi are the only 2 who have contributed to the success of this film. The story is completely messy with several flaws and it's displayed in a very confusing and unstructured manner. The villainous doctor is over dramatic and acts like he's in some circus show. He is also very dumb for a psychiatrist. I was doubting why Fahad would pick such a film. Maybe he was just flexing his acting skills which were as usual amazing.

People who have watched the film Shutter Island, can immediately see similar patterns in the initial parts of the movie thus giving away a huge amount of suspense. It's basically a poor copy of Shutter Island but with a little twist.",3
Athiran,"Athiran is the newest addition to thrillers list in Mollywood. Athiran keeps us engaged most of the parts. The making of the movie is good but not excellent and not as good as other recent Mollywood thriller 9 (Nine). Fahadh Faasil is good and will not offer a better performance than his recent outings. It is Sai Pallavi who impresses and eve though it is her difficult role yet, she pulls off it fine. The main problems of Athiran is its predictability. The narration makes us clear that the protagonist is something more than what he appears. The songs and background music were good but one romantic song in second half was unwanted and spoils the thrilling mood. Overall, Athiran is a very good attempt by debutant Vivek and is a one time watchable thriller.",3
Athiran,"Watched today from gtracks theatre without any expectation ,without going thru any reviews or even trailer. Felt the best experience. You must watch it from theatre. I saw trailer now and feel it's not upto mark, compared to movie.Can say for sure one of the best thriller movies recently released . Hollywood standard. I wondered why wikipedia giving full plot of story. It certainly ruins viewing experience",5
Athiran,"One cannot express this with words, if done.. words overflow occursA movie that happens deep inside a deserted forest.. surrounded by mountains, rivers.. and beautiful backgroundDeserted land, huge hospital where hell of creepy things occur.Even if I give out spoilers, its the movie visuals that treats the eye laying structure for the scriptFahad fasil, occurs to present himself before the hospital, a mental hospital to be precise, for an inspection of the disallowed practises being carried out for treating of patients thereHe is in a quest to disprove the validity of the hospital and its doctor (Mr. kulkarni, as always shines in his role)His quest brings out many revelations about the darker sides. A prisoner, who is under treatment for autistic and violent behaviour is the stone to turn.He turns the stone and the hunt begins.Movie swifts like reader turning pages of book for climax. Each and every pages of script is beautiful to watchAthiran goes to any extent. Hence Athiran",5
Uriyadi 2,"This script was really heart touching , climax and Bgm was awesome - every on should watch we must understand wat is reality in our state even our country situation and where going Hats off to Vijay .... we need more like this kind of movie to open up the blind eyes ( this is my first one hope might be some one read this )",5
Uriyadi 2,"One of the very few Tamil directors who handled the original script..the best political film in this decade.while some directors copying the script from other languages or country or people...vijayakumar doing the best art with the social message in his very own way.People celebrating this young director.movie is an epic and outstanding like his previous film ""Uriyadi """,5
Uriyadi 2,Don't miss it...bcz this movie msss political movie just awesome..,5
Uriyadi 2,"Movie shows the real face of Corporates, caste based politicians and spineless ruling party. Currently reflects the situation of Tuticorin incident in Tamilnadu. Although climax ended good which won't happen in real because Corporates has influence and money to buy even central boards. Some scenes took long time to complete. Otherwise Title reflects the point inside the film. Cracked and exposed everything.",5
Uriyadi 2,"Vijay Kumar who was the director and actor of Uriyadi,gives a political thriller for the audience of Tamil cinema which will be really helpful to election coming ahead. Violence was a bit low comparing to Uriyadi 1.A lot of heart touching scenes. The climax was a lit. Bassically, please watch this before election.",5
Captain Marvel,It was absolutely AWFUL. my mate walked out after half hour.. I was embarrassed and watched it until about an hour in.. then I couldn't take it anymore. It's truly terrible. Lol,1
Captain Marvel,"This actress is so untalented, uncharismatic and just... Bad! If you are not a hardcore Marvel fan DO NOT even try to watch this movie. It's really disappointed, not even Samuel L Jackson could save it",1
Captain Marvel,"Firstly, is this movie really 1 Star? No.. but I felt like I needed to do everything possible to bring it's score down from the 7.1 is currently has.. a simply inaccurate and unfounded score. In reality I'd give it around a 5.7.Marvel has come a long way, but this movie was a step backwards.. and it's an insult to the franchise. It felt like they wanted to quickly add a new character to their cinema world, and while they were at it.. snag a wider demographic. That's all well and good, but not when you lose sight of making a decent movie..Final Comments:-You DO NOT need to watch this movie before rolling into Avengers: Endgame..
-If you trust marvel to keep making good movies, sure, spend money on this.. but you've been warned.
To frame this for you, this felt like the worst attempt at a DC movie.. and those are slowly getting better.. if this trend continues, DC will release higher quality films and take Marvel's place as the premium 'Superhero' franchise.",1
Captain Marvel,"I am not a huge comic book fan but enjoyed most Marvel movies for their action and humour as well as their interesting stories. Other than losing points for SJW garbage, the story just seemed to be a string of events. It had no highs and lows. A bunch of stuff happened for 2 hours. I heard they had to rewrite the ending several times which shows it had a weak idea of the story.",1
Captain Marvel,"Bad writing forced female lead
A propaganda movie.
Captain America retold but bad.
Pure trash a waste of money and time.
A CGI cat and a dead guy the only ones remerbamble from the movie",1
Captain Marvel,"First thing, I am a huge fan of the Marvel Franchise. I believe Disney is doing a great job. And I was really looking forward to seeing Captain Marvel. But then Brie Larson told me not to. She said she didn't want or need ""me"" (a white male in my forties) to support it. Really Disney? Ugh, So I eventually got past that and was going to see it this week. And then again, she says she is using this new platform to spread her agenda. Really Disney? It is a comic book based movie. We watch these movies for entertainment and yes for some inspiration too. But to slam an entire generation that bought into these storylines and kept them alive over the years so you could make billions of dollars from them was wrong. If there was an apology from her on that very first derogatory statement she made I would be all in . But nothing. So Disney you will not get a dime rom me in regards to this movie. Well I may buy the Nick Fury Marvel Legends figure. But sadly that is it. And I am sure in a month it will be on one of my streaming services. By all the reviews on here about this movie, I won't wait long.",1
Captain Marvel,"This movie was complete garbage. Agree or don't but I love Marvel films, I owe everyone of them, and all the comics. However I was so disappointed in this marvel film. It was way more focused I think of the feminist movement rather than the actual Captain Marvel. It lacked on so many points, it dragged out and then was not even a shocker when the truth came out because you could figure it out by 20 minuets into the movie. They did more explaining how nick lost his eye, where the tesseract came from, how the avengers got their name rather then focusing on Captain Marvel.",1
Captain Marvel,"Formulaic and predictable. The pacing was sparatic and felt as though your being drug through the mud. You know how it will play out and finally end. Do yourself a favor, skip it and save the money.",1
Captain Marvel,Save your money... this is easily a 1/10. The acting from Brie Larson is so trash. The whole movie is just plain bad and boring. Easily the worst Marvel movie to date in my opinion.,1
Captain Marvel,"I am quite embarrassed with the movie like thank god I didn't watch it in IMAX 3D .
yes acting is neutral . scarlet Johansson and Gal Gadot has benchmark the female super hero movies. the only thing I pray is Captain marvel down kill thanos . it will be the biggest mistake marvel will commit . absolute blunder .
there is no wow moment , comic timing is average . but carol denvers doesn't have it in her . Brei Larson is one of the worst addition to avengers world .",1
Captain Marvel,"I was hoping for it to be a good movie but really it is a very mediocre movie.
Too much of the SJW rhetoric and forced toxic feminism.
Really Disney? I really loved that you didn't push too much of the SJW agenda in your other movies but this one is a bit over the top.
Don't waste your money and time on this movie
If I wanted to get the dose of toxic feminism I would've watched CNN or MSNBC. But seeing this poop of a movie when I pay my money for it.....it's a torture.",1
Captain Marvel,Nothing to watch..15-20 minutes max you can spend on this one.Bunch of clips added together to show a unrealistic looking super hero.,1
Captain Marvel,"Worse Marvel movie by far, do not watch it I repeat do not watch this film",1
Captain Marvel,Bad marvel movies of all time cgi was good but movie was boring,1
Captain Marvel,"Just got home from seeing the movie and immediately told all my fellow MCU fans they need to see it. Then I hop on here and see negative review after negative review and I disagree with most of them! Feels like I was in a different movie!
Only thing I will agree with was bad is the fact that we don't know of a Captain Marvel weakness. She's insanely overpowered. But I mean, so is Scarlet Witch if you think about it. Scarlet Witch could take down any of the Avengers if she wanted to. And she sorta did, in Ultron when she was making all of them see their worst fears. (By the way why has she not done that since that movie? But that's besides the point) The only weakness Scarlet Witch has/had was her love for Vision. But that wasn't introduced until later in her story. So I don't think it's bad that we don't know Captain Marvel's weakness yet. This is the MCU, she will have more storyline, this was just setting up for more to come.
I actually think Brie Larson's acting was great. We learn very early in the movie that her character's being trained to control her emotions and impulses. That's the only thing she knows as she has no prior memories. Of course she's a little flat because of that. But then I find her character builds and develops as now she has the powers to match her confidence and ambition which gives her even more purpose. She starts regaining her memories and you can see her unfold as she feels love her old friend and the daughter. She stands up against the Kree people who she used to trust and shows them she's better off without them. She gives the Skrulls a chance and ends up fighting for them, and giving up her renewed life on earth for them. I find her to be a very different character towards the end than she is in the beginning.
Do people keep forgetting that this movie takes place in the 90's? This was an early beginning story for both Fury and Coulson. Neither of them have gone through any of the crap they soon will so I think it's well done that their characters were quite different. They will develop with time. If you watch this movie, then all the other Marvel movies in chronological order, it'd be more clear. They also joke that Coulson is the ""new guy"", which to me explains his slightly timid attitude.
I went into this movie trying to not let the politics affect my opinion. If you go into the movie already with a bad taste in your mouth, you might be disappointed. And I in no way support some of the things Brie Larson has said and done. But I don't find that any of that was brought into the movie and I am capable of letting those two instances be separate. I don't have to love and support every actor/actress in a movie in order to love the movie.
I am a female in my mid-20's and I felt very empowered by this movie. My 29-year-old brother felt empowered. I feel like this movie is intended to be motivational for all audiences and doesn't try to tear anyone down.
Goose was amazing and adorable up until he eats the bad guys. That was weird and uncomfortable to me but ok. Still love Goose!
Is it the best Marvel has done? No. But I am overall very pleased with the movie and will be seeing it again and again.
I just wish it gave us more teasers towards the rest of the Avengers and Endgame but I guess I can wait another month for that! If I have to!",4
Captain Marvel,"I've liked Brie Larson in other films, but she showed ZERO range in this. When your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable, you already have a problem. In addition, Captain Marvel has no weaknesses, which kills the tension immediately. There is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing, or any danger at all for that matter.It's an OK origin story, but it makes no sense as to WHY she's supposedly so powerful.The cat was good.",2
Captain Marvel,"I'll make it very simple and clear: Captain Marvel is not really worth a watch. It's visually impressive but blandI am not a bot. I am white female in her 40's.
I have watched MCU from the beginning and have loved the journey. At the end of the movies, I have felt that I watched something that has left me feeling, excited.
Well, that did not happen today when I saw Captain Marvel. I felt flat and indifferent.
Carol Danvers was the same at end and she was in the beginning. Carol did not inspire me at all. Carol was boring. I was never invested in carol Danvers at all.
Sure some parts were ok. Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Maria Rambeau, Monica Rambeau were great characters. Yon-Rogg or as I will call him Yawn-Rogg.
If fact pretty much the whole movie is a yawn.
The fight scene with No Doubt's I'm just a Girl music choice is sad. They could have gone with Pat Benatar's Hit me with your best shot.
After watching YouTube (yes I know) I discovered that one of the first Captain Marvel was a woman of colour. Why, did they not cast a women of colour. Black Panther showed the way to inspire people, me included. But, no they missed a huge opportunity and went with a safe bet on a white woman.
If you want to see the mid credit scene, don't waste your time. Watch the mid credit scene on YouTube.
I am hoping the rumours are true and Marvel has a alternative version where Captain Marvel has a minor part in Avengers Endgame.
I am nervous about Avengers Endgame that the powers that be have destroyed a decade of Marvel movies to satisfy a minority.
How about create a great character that happens to be a women.",1
Captain Marvel,"Movie is just so boring and bland because the main lead character has no vulnerability... And the emotional range of Brie Larson was low. The movie doesn't live up to the hype. Only good thing i would say was Samuel L Jackson, The cat, 90s nostalgia & Jude law.",1
Captain Marvel,"Marvel is repeating the same formula in the last years, it's not difficult to predict every single scene in Captain Marvel. It's all predictable. I wasn't surprised in any moment. Good special effects, weak plot. Don't worth the ticket, just wait to see it on TV.",2
Captain Marvel,"Just terrible! I really wanted to like it, but couldn't. So dull and Brie Larson was terrible! Really Marvel? This was such a let down!",1
Captain Marvel,"The wife wanted to see it and im a Marvel fan so I thought it would be a good idea to watch it for a date night. Long story short, we both left the theater disappointed. Acting, story, and flow sucked.",1
Captain Marvel,"A lot of things that are happening in the move are inconsequential to the plot, the character, and even in avengers.",1
Captain Marvel,SO boring movie and no more jokes and comedy in this movie,1
Captain Marvel,"Not great movie. It's so boring.
VFX normal not good.",1
Captain Marvel,Was looking forward to this as a big fan of Brie Larson - its v bad. Don't bother.,2
Airaa,The movie would start off with excitement with decent scares comedy and acting. It will also build up to a good suspense and questions the nose dive off all excitement starts with the flash back. It even dives to the deepest pit when they come up with the reasons of all actions.,2
Airaa,"Nayanthara double role her acting is good
but story is a let down",1
Airaa,Are you a lazy person? Definitely watch this film that shows the importance of time in a horror outline. Double action by the lady superstar as well. A fairly good ghost elements make the film a family entertainer.,5
Airaa,"Wow! This was not only a great horror movie but a great movie, period! In effect it was about the ripple effect of our everyday actions. As a horror movie it was about an evil spirit and the reason she had for killing. 1st off, just the screen presence of Nayanthara was enough to like this movie. What a performance! And the construction of this movie was simply textbook. This might also be one of the best storylines for a horror movie as well. And what about the music soundtrack? It was a very integral part of the movie. It made it just that much better! Think of the soundtrack for It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(which Total Dhamaal was a remake). So the ensemble cast was perfect, the cinematography was perfect, in short, the whole movie was perfect! Don't wait another day, see this movie now!",5
Airaa,"Good efforts . Lady Super start performing well , nayantara . Expecting better ending .",5
Airaa,"A mediocre attempt at trying to mix and mash the butterfly effect and the horror genre. Your eyes will beg for reprive after watching this senseless story where characters like the granny, fat dude and babloo have been added just to fill the large glaring loopholes, who serve no actual purpose and just confuse the viewer.
Please do yourself a favor and miss this movie!",1
Airaa,At first I was so excited to watch this movie after watching it's trailer. But then I feel so disappointed because it's nothing that I expected. Nayanthara's acting is very remarkable. For sure she had come out of her safe zone. But the story lacks something. Overall it's a one time watchable movie,3
Arjun Reddy,"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years.",4
Arjun Reddy,"Disclaimer: Not for telugu movie lovers who want 4 songs, 3 fights, couple of high budget sequences and 1 freaking mega family hero.This movie is an awesome mirror to how the present generation in India is. The story line, screenplay and the BGM are top notch.Movie starts off with the main character looking shoddy (like a modern day devadas) and his only intention is to flirt, f*** and finish off. it is only when you slowly slip into the movie that you realize that either you or one of your friends from college is of the same type. Anger management is the main theme of the movie and the director intelligently shows the difference in mindset of the character per and post falling in love.The supporting actors are like the friends of ours who are like shoulders to cry on or sit accordinglyGot to give credits to the Director for running the movie for full 3 hours without the distracting love duets/mass songs ( saved 25 mins of his time to convey the story better)The subject line is raw and to the point with the plot revolving only around the hero. At no point one feels bored (unless someone doesn't like the plot all together).BGM by the music director is amazing. it goes slowly and smoothly with the mood of the movieMain let down would be the climax: which looked hurried and commercialized for the movie buffs",5
Arjun Reddy,"Watch the teaser first: JAW DROPPING, then trailer GOOSEBUMPS and then the Movie (A MOVIE THAT'S GOT SOME B**LS). The Love story of Arjun Reddy was portrayed in such a dark & intense way and hence I call it the CULT Classics of the Telugu Film Industry. The movie was goddamn natural (non-commercial) and watching it, i believe most of the people might have felt these emotions at some point of their lives. Its very hard to find such a Beautiful story in this commercialized movie world. Vijay's performance was flawless. His character takes you to your past and makes you cry, blood boil and heart melt. Some brilliant performance from supporting actors like Rahul who plays his best friend Shiva. I just loved Shiva's character as he is the Spinal Cord of the movie. Soul satisfying music. Hatsoff to Director Sandeep Vanga for introducing this kind of a movie to Telugu Film industry. Very good and important messages conveyed, much needed for this generation youth. The movie is a long 3 hour movie but is worth every minute. GO WATCH IT. I am lucky to have watched this movie #UNCENSORED.",5
Arjun Reddy,"Impressed after seeing this movies last night. I congratulate Debut director Sandeep choosing such the bold subject and the suitable artists. Another impressive thing is that there are no star kids acted in this movie, there are no star producers produced this movie. The story and narration is realistic and natural. Vijay Devarakonda mesmerized with his acting skills, body language and attitude shown as Arjun Reddy character, Congratulations and this is an award winning performance and your hard work. Background score of this movies is hilarious with respect to the screen play. Expecting more and more this kind of movies in Tollywood.",5
Arjun Reddy,"Kudos ! To the entire team, especially to the director Sandeep Sir, getting all the emotions and feelings aptly. The presentation of the characters are very bold as they are refined products as to be what they are. Grilled each and every character to be yourself. The message is very clear be yourself.Thank You so much sir for a very good film.",0
Arjun Reddy,"The love in Arjun Reddy is pure, unabashedly bold and hard-hitting. It touches the soul in ways it can't be explained. It gives the story a modern-day Devdas twist, while making the overall cinematic experience a journey to remember for a long time.This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy(Vijay DeveraKonda), and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep and Vijay, as director and hero, make the film for what it is, and both have paved the way for a new chapter in Telugu film History. If it was Pellichoopulu and Kshanam last year, it's Arjun Reddy in 2017, and these films assure there is light at the end of the tunnel.As much as the film belongs to Sandeep, who is also its writer, it equally belongs to Vijay Devarakonda, who is the life of Arjun Reddy. Vijay breathes life into the character and it's impossible to imagine anyone else in his shoes. Be it his passion, love, and rage; he portrays these several layers of his character with unparalleled realism.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Arjun Reddy most original, experimental and daring work to come out Telugu cinema in a long time.",5
Arjun Reddy,"This is the story of a guy and somewhat a girl, who are in deep love, develop strong relations, the girl getting married off to another, the guy getting addicted to booze, drugs, and a beard - an essential accessory for any Telugu film hero with disastrous love affair. The film starts with the hero (Vijay Sai Deverakonda) as a doctor in unkempt avatar with unpleasant characteristics. The provenance of the beard can be traced back to a violent fracas on football field, causing a showdown with a colourless dean. In defence, the hero serves up first of many infantile philosophies that pepper the film. He says ""Football is a violent sport"" (it is not), he plays for satisfaction, not medals. His friend who accompanies him, orders the class to stand up and ""respect the champion"". Every student stands up instantaneously as if national anthem has been set loose all of a sudden. They are so supine, scared, and scarred by the braggadocio of the guy who is permanently angry for no reason.However he is supposed to be great at sudies, excels in sports, eventually would do record operations even when drunk and drugged, and in spare time, when not emitting sexist rants, flies spaceships (I made up one of those). He also administers anatomical drawings on body, as a teaching aid, as if he were a modern day Vesalius. The director's idea of demonstrating keen intellect is to show him staring with keen anger while delivering juvenile banter as some sort of profoundness. Women are supposed to throw at his feet, even when he hits rock bottom, drunkard and jobless drug addict - such are these Telugu films.Enter, Preeti the first year fresher, who has instant anodyne effect on the hero. Ever since he is besotted with her, he marks her as his property by planting a kiss on her cheek without her consent. Later in the film, we would hear another insipid philosophical babble on his 'private space' that should be respected by others, of course, being a 'free spirit', he could invade others' space at will if they happen to be women. There starts the dog like devotion and aggressive possessiveness of the hero. In time honoured convention in Telugu films, the hero lays claim to her, 'protects' her from ragging predators. Warming up to dog motif, again, without her knowledge, people label her 'his girl', just as one would say 'his dog', which is a good template to understand his attitude towards her. Only thing he does not objectify is one real dog in the film, which is elevated to human, whereas the girl is downgraded to a faithful dog. In many scenes, you might as well replace the dog with the girl, as the dog barely barks and the girl rarely speaks. Then he hears of Preeti being marked rather inappropriately by another male dog during Holi celebrations. That heralds a sequence of rage filled obscene expletives which are now celebrated for being bold, raw, intense never before shown in Telugu films, director breaking the conventions of ordinary films making. The abuse is of course very conventional, targeting women, uttered by the hero (yes the same guy who would prattle pretentiously on how not to objectify women), to avenge the vile touch. The girl falls into his arms for protecting her honour, somewhat in Taliban style. And Telugu hero must acquire another essential accessory - a second heroine, of course with zero dignity. His treatment of her resembles kicking out a dog when he wanted to reject her.Showdown with the girl's father: The director often needs squalid characters to show hero in better light. The domineering father is a rank casteist stereotype who detests guy. He catches him kissing her at his home and angrily confronts him. By this time the director probably has convinced some good number of audience to fondly imagine that it is perfectly acceptable to visit someone's home, kiss their daughter and demand what the hero later blathers about as 'private space'. The girl's marriage is forcefully fixed and the hero gives her six hours to make up her mind to move out with him. What is the best way to reinforce his point to the woman? Slap her of course. He is medieval, but as we are told, he is a free spirit, so it is supposed to be ok.Then there is a ridiculous, completely out of context scene about PMS, contrived to show the audience how sensitive he is to female concerns, as if to tell 'I am not a sexist beast, I have this delicate side', crassly exploiting to extract brownie points. In another scene, the director makes him sermonise a moronic NRI not to objectify women. The characters surrounding the male lead are cardboard which is at least two dimensional. The hero is unidimensional, with angry face at one end, and pseudo empathetic drivel on the other.During his disciplinary hearings, he remembers Hippocratic oath, presenting himself as a guy with integrity. Such pangs of conscience! This guy does not remember the pledge we are drilled down in schools. ""All Indians are my brothers and sisters"". This sounds like kitsch, but intended to reflect fraternal spirit from the three pillars of Indian constitution - liberty, equality, fraternity. There is little fraternal feeling in this pledge loving bloke. When the girl's father asks him to look after his daughter like a ""sister"", he utters ""he does not have sisters"" in a pompous tone mocking Preeti's father for his old fashioned thinking. His own thinking or lack of it towards women is rather antediluvian. Even then, a character admiringly rambles that he has never seen a free spirit like this guy in a democracy. He neither understands free spirit, nor democracy (unless the free spirit means free booze), and spews this arrant nonsense. Coming to think of it, people in lunatic asylum are free spirits too. A man who needs a muse to be a lamb, but deforms into a brute ('free spirit') and loses self control when he loses her is fundamentally a weak person, though his brutishness appears as a sign of strength.While he is growing a beard, Preeti is growing his child, heavily pregnant. This is going to be film about beard, borne like a cross, not a potentially career ending silly pregnancy. A shawl would have added to the hero's pathos, but is too ethnic for our westernized pseudo progressive. He is an odious sociopath, but since he is handsome, needs escape route. Conveniently grandma dies, creating instantaneous transformation, faster than 2-minute noodles, manifested by the removal of that blasted beard. He is a changed man. Whatever changed, his propensity to deliver incomprehensible gibberish as philosophy does not cease, and his dad, mesmerised, has instant transformation himself (since loss of beard is the ""game changer"" of Telugu cinema). If only his friends found him a decent barber in time...never mind, better late than never.Anthony Hopkins as Dr.Hannibal Lecter remarks while lobotomising Ray Liotta's policeman that he did not need that part of the brain dealing with good manners. Our hero surely seemed to miss this part, even without a lobotomy, as demonstrated by his crude language with nurses, about patients, friends, especially regarding women. (By the way isn't Dr.Lecter a high end 'free spirit', with impeccable manners?). Once he asks his married classmate 'inkaa neellosukoledaa', enquiring about her pregnancy. When he sees a woman, he sees them as baby making machinery of future Arjun Reddys.Finally what did this path breaking film break? The dialogues sound casual without bombastic music. Nothing new, if one observed some old Telugu films (e.g. Rojulu maaraayi (1955), shaavukaru(1950) ). Story is banal, narration is dragging; comedy shines sometimes with outstanding Rahul Ramakrishna's Siva, but comic potential in Telugu films is enormous and not particularly novel. Songs: not having been bombarded with pre-release audio tracks to condition auricular senses, did not particularly find them greatly appealing. Much is made of Vijay Devarakonda's action, but superior performances come from Kanchana and Rahul Ramakrishna who transformed normal roles into scene stealing glue that holds this dismal film together. Maniacal roles are not the best yardsticks of performance. They inject more to the character than any acting. Batman's Joker is an example, with the actors having high chance of receiving high accolades! His performance is decent, but no better than in another of his recent films 'pelli choopulu' (2016). Then what is unique? This differs from others in using cuss words, peppering with obscene gratuitous expletives, under the pretence of showing realism, and the director is showered with epithets of 'bold' 'raw', 'honest'. Perhaps, dicing the film with even filthier language would have been termed ""bolder"". And of course, heavily publicised kissing (creating a very useful marketable controversy) . He also created one of the shallowest female leads, even by the abysmal standards of Telugu cinema, quite a feat. He is hailed as some sort of Sergei Eisenstein of Telugu films for this crudity. Forgot, there is another first by our Eisenstein. Never before seen piddling in the pants. Can any one beat that? Truly, ""bold"", ""raw"" , ""path breaking"" is alive and pissing. If you are not convinced by the dog motif mentioned earlier, this scene should confirm great canine like qualities of the hero, this time marking himself - a symbolic statement of his self indulgent narcissism. The ultra westernized tenor gives pretensions of modernity covering up misogynist behaviour. We can only expect more of such 'youth' films. On the opposite end, we have traditionalists who want to impose their own authority under the pretext of protecting women from western influences. Women will be caught out in a pincer movement of devil of and the deep blue sea.",3
Arjun Reddy,"Any guy can relate to this movie right from starting to end. This movie gives a shot of a drug that gets injected slowly into your body and could take a while to come out of the hang over. I loved the pre- interval scene and the back ground music is just awesome. Vijay's performance is way beyond. Except kids, everyone else can watch this movie.",5
Arjun Reddy,"Brilliant direction with organically written dialogues and an excellent cast. What stands out most in this film when compared to other Telugu films is the lack of hero worship, a story that lies close to reality and the portrayal of love in its pure form. Vijay uplifted the film to an entirely different level, giving it the kind of craze that it has. Radhan's music has done wonderfully with the frames and the scenes. Films like this would directly affect the Indian youth. The dialogues and the direction has made it clear that it is against the idea of objectifying women like most Telugu movies do with their item songs and unrealistic love stories which barely involve interaction on-screen. The protagonist has admirable qualities despite the fact that he has anger management issues and is, for a particular period, addicted to drinking. True love is timeless and tireless. No reason is strong enough for it to break, and this film showed us just that.",5
Arjun Reddy,"Director : Being his first movie, he did the best. Actor : Vijay devarakonda dedication is fabulous. Actress : Simple. Co-Actors : Superb. Songs: All are situational and background play songs (no lip moments of Actor/actress) Sandeep reddy vanga simply said true love never ends, and he is the first director from TFI to show love in correct way in my point of view. Sound mixing is fantabulous. BGM is awesome.",5
Arjun Reddy,"The emotions in the love story are nothing more than kissing, and the word ""baby"". The protagonist always has some philosophy to cover up for the situation to prove that he is correct. The father/brother emotions are not sufficiently built. It would have been good if the brother characterization was built better, as to how he attempts to save his brother, or how the family would free him from drug addiction through showing of love. Overall, more of a story that dives deeper and deeper into tragedy. The boy is shown to be an excellent doctor. Even to excel in profession/academics, I believe a person would need to have a lot better self-control than what the protagonist seems to possess.",1
Arjun Reddy,"Liberate tutu me ex inferis. my goal is to save innocent bakras from watching this movie.I am wasting even more time on this movie posting this to save others. after reading my synopsis if you want to watch this, dont say there was no warning. the ""hero: is an overly aggressive psychopathic Dbag who smokes, drinks, gets high , operates while high. He overdoses while his brother is getting high and shows no feelings when he ignores his brothers and fathers feelings for screwing up the wedding. The cherry on the top being the ""heroine"" is pregnant with his child. she also does not let her husband even touch her dirty clothes- her words not mine. Her father shows excellent judgement in diagnosing the Dbag but she still loves him any way. The people who made this movie seem to have trouble differentiating free spirit and a psychopath who also happens to be a douche. Save yourselves from hell!",1
Arjun Reddy,"Ok, I am lost here, saw this movie yesterday after all that hype and hungaama and I really don't get how this film is truly different and mind-blowing! Are people only talking about the characterisation, which I will agree is quite strong and unapologetic. Vijay Deverakonda lives and breathes into this role. He is soo natural, almost too natural making us wonder if he has the same off-screen personality as well, which is a bit scary. Coming to the story, I am really not sure what the director wanted to convey. Did he want to tell us that it is bad being rude and acting on impulse .. and that such people strongly needs therapy?? I understand that Arjun Reddy has anger issues and acts impulsively, but it is soo stupid that his love interest, Preeti also does the same, where she was supposed to be the sane one. She gets married to some random dude, despite being totally in love with Arjun because he did not answer his phone for a single day due to a drug overdose!!!??? And this is what people are calling as a revolutionary cult classic!!! The second half is full of his downward spiral of Arjun Reddy and it is tedious watching this! Despite all his doings, he suddenly has flashes of remorse, especially in front of the lawyers and this is soo unconvincing. The ending saves this film a bit but makes all his suffering almost pointless. At any moment, Preeti could have ended his suffering instead we get a sub-plot with a film star thrown in and also countless moments where Arjun Reddy almost gets to kick the bucket!Really, all this could have been justifiable, if the conflict point between the two lovers was strong. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, it is the weakest aspect which brings the entire film down.",2
Arjun Reddy,"Kudos to director Sandeep for coming up with a bold and one-of-a- kind film in Telugu. He sticks to his script without any deviations. Sandeep is definitely a daring director, who has shown a new way forward with Arjun Reddy.This is Vijay Deverakonda's film all the way. He is sensational as Arjun Reddy. He completely transforms into the character and lives it. Undoubtedly, he is going to be the future poster-boy of Telugu cinema. He acts effortlessly, just like an experienced star. Rahul Ramakrishna as Vijay's friend is another surprise find, mouthing his dialogues in a natural way. Shalini makes an excellent debut, and shows no signs of being a newcomer. She is perfect for her role, which she carries with grace.Arjun Reddy, it sure is a sensation for Telugu cinema, and all the credit goes to director Sandeep for coming up with a subject like this. Although this is his debut film, one feels like he is an old hand. On his part, Vijay Deverakonda brings Arjun Reddy alive. A film not to be missed!!!",5
Arjun Reddy,"This movie glorifies drinks, drugs and an aggressive angry young man. This movie doesn't have any sense and in my opinion it's a very average movie like a country movie where locals are portrayed as big hero who drinks and does throw tantrums but around in a modern look. I hate this movie being rated too high for nothing.",0
Arjun Reddy,"This film IMO is one of the worst South Indian films I've ever seen in a long time. The protagonist, a would-be successful surgeon, looses it when his physician girlfriend is married off to one of the local boys. He spends months in a downward spiral, which only halted after his grandmother dies. Although Vijay is a favorite of many, I found his character in this film to be very irritating. I also thought the story line was disjointed and unconvincing. This is not real world, it is plain and simple nonsense. I got a headache watching it. What a disappointment!",2
Arjun Reddy,"I get the intention of this story but its just too lengthy and tests your patience in every minute after first 30 minutes, the lead character Arjun Reddy is highly unlikable and keeps us questioning why his friends stay 'friends' with him/ keep up with him, despite his retarded attitude towards everything.. which only should belong to an asylum. People are just praising this movie because they were just put into a corner and asked them to judge it by its advertised ""raw- bold- intense- and honest"" bull-sh*t words, which they have used it everywhere where ever the movie got advertised. Audience just couldn't decide what the F this movie is about. If you really ask an individual as to why they liked it, they will start searching for words and reasons and to their rescue the makers of this movie already have given them those words to public from day 1 of its trailer and they will start by saying ""its raw"" ""its bold"" ""its intense"" ""its honest"" ""its emotional"". People are out and out shy to admit that ""there's nothing much"" in this movie.. just F***n admit that this is a piece of SH** Just at least learn not to feel ashamed and admit that you do not see the point of this horrendous film.",2
Arjun Reddy,Wasted 3 hours after watching this. The hero thinks he can do anything and act like a complete psychopath and there will be no consequences. He is a DOCTOR for Christ's sake.,1
Arjun Reddy,"The movie is too raw. Also, there's nothing too great about the story. For the most part, it's nothing but smoking and drinking-plain. Movies have a profound influence on the society and I believe that the directors should feel responsible when they're portraying situations or activities that leave a deep impact on the young impressionable minds. If it wasn't for the ending I wouldn't have cared to give this a negative rating. Pain exists when things don't turn our way but it need not be shown in a vulgar fashion to say that the pain is intense. And the 3* I gave was for the ending. For the rest, its 0. I know that most of the readers who go through this may not agree with me, at all. But, this is what I feel.",2
Arjun Reddy,"A window to peek into the mind of a brilliant medical student who fits the description of bipolar disorder and or borderline personality. Yes, a flawed personality. But, what's perfection anyway? The naming of the illness is unfortunate and when one can make a leap over and look past that, it's all about emotional dysregulation. When it comes to the naming of the film, it's apt as it narrates the story of the namesake and does just that, without judging or glorifying. Here too, one needs to look past the reservations against profanity, substance abuse, sexual intercourse etc..and better yet, come to terms with all of the above. A romantic at heart, passionate about what he loves, an idealist who can be reckless, arrogant and entitled too. A person who can see what could be and is conflicted with what is and can't deal with the reality with a calm composure. One who has little tolerance towards nonsense and lives by high expectations. A perfectionist who isn't perfect. A bipolar journey, where your mood dictates. The intensity of emotions is high. The art of embracing emotions and doing what is effective is absent. There is no consistency, as in life. The behavior is out of scale to the triggers as per the usual norm. A parted love draws him into a sombre place; a departed soul shakes him and sorts him out.Explosive, obsessive and compulsive, intolerant, substance-abusing, refusing help, humiliating people who help, belittling friends, failing to apologize - these just characterize his cries for help. When it comes to a medical surgery, he can get through successfully even when he is intoxicated. But when it comes to an emotion, he can't handle gracefully as expected by the society. His friend - who almost doubles as his therapist - knows his pain, helps him cope with the hurt especially when he doesn't like his choices or agree with his behavior and in spite of the insults he receives. He separates him from the behavior. It's hard to see that way and stay supportive. Which is what everyone deserves. Especially people with a mental illness need that kind of empathy to survive. It's hard to care for such an intelligent yet turbulent being. It's an imposition. There are no bad people, there is only bad behavior. There is always a cause. And a consequence. The lesson here is to understand pain, help to alleviate the suffering and then the biggest of them all...to forgive. It's all about empathy. He thinks he could have been a neurosurgeon if not for love and other distractions. I wish he were, he could've known the brain anatomy better, how his amygdala, hippocampus, insula or the prefrontal cortex work. The mere knowledge wouldn't help to prevent any behavior but that would definitely help handle the consequences better and might help manage his mental health better. A person who understands objectification of women and talks like a feminist, but at times, when it comes to his own love life, he acts like a predator, choosing his mate, making his moves, and marking his territory, almost abusive, dictating even who she needs to be friends with and violate her taking advantage of his senior status, almost coercing her to accept his stance. She doesn't fight back either and falls in love too. It almost feels like glorifying a lion and the lamb kind of a story. Almost doesn't count. So, let's give some benefit of the doubt. I wish there was more to the girl's characterization before their break up to clear any ambiguity. In a society where you are expected not to lose your virginity until you are married, where the concept of dating is still frowned upon and the religion you're born into (whether observed or not), caste system (whether you care or not) and financial status of your parents (which is irrelevant), food habits (by birth or by choice) even become objections to love. PMS is mentioned (although the failed mention that it's not always physical), pre-marital sex which is still a taboo is depicted, this movie is a litmus test to a society that still attributes virginity to women even more so than men, also, pregnancy which is normally attributed to the mother rather than the couple. A society where a mother can almost never have a conversation with her girl along the lines ""Have you guys kissed? Are you guys being safe?"" Above all, the terms and technicalities of the subject of mental health are completely alien or beyond comprehension for those who don't have first person exposure, which is the majority of such society. Despite the cinematic cop-out of a climax (except for the strength of the character to accept the baby before the truth is revealed ), it's not after all a promise to a ""happily lived ever after"" life. There will be more episodes in his life or he may not relapse at all. That's the nature of such disorders. There is no taking control or grit when comes to the ways of a brain. People do need to understand this. More than any other emotion, anger is the most complicated to fathom and to accept. Knowledge is out there for those who seek but wisdom is not a guarantee. And dare I say, this story holds true with a female protagonist too. A bipolar woman breaking up with her partner, suffering through the aftermath, making choices against the norm ...pregnant or not, who tries to move on or not, gets back together or not..it's all the same.I dream of the day when the world is no longer in need of feminism. I dream of the day when the intangible pain of the mind is given the same credence as bodily pain, if not more, and any disorder is mentioned without a negative connotation, and the stigma around mental illness truly disappears, and seeking therapy need not be a secret, resulting in better mental health.",5
Arjun Reddy,"Arjun Reddy (2017): Arjun Reddy got immense craze which is no less than the craze Kabali got.Youth went crazy after watching its trailers and posters especially because of its cuss words and kiss scenes which are quite bold to Telugu audience.But what came as a surprise is its realistic and honest portrayal of love stories.Plot: Arjun Reddy (Vijay Devarakonda), an ortho doctor has issues with alcoholism. He is an efficient ortho surgeon, but on the personal front, he is an alcoholic. And the reason for his turning into one is his love failure during his college days in Mangalore Medical College.While in college, he falls for first year student of MBBS. Preeti (Shalini) too likes him and their edgy love affair begins. Her father doesn't agree to their relationship and a huge tussle happens between Arjun Reddy and Preeti's family. This results in Preeti's father marrying her off to another person.After knowing that she got married, Arjun Reddy turns alcoholic and his anger issues further escalate. He becomes a modern-day version of Devdas who takes to alcohol, drugs, and tries to distance himself from the society.Rest of the story showcases the journey of Arjun Reddy as to how he regains his senses and gets back to normal.My Review: Arjun Reddy may have attracted audience with all the cuss words and smooches but it is one of the most realistic love stories in recent times.Arjun Reddy is like Kumari 21f of males.Sandeep Vanga has chosen an unconventional way to give new feel to audience.This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy, and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep presents Vijay's character from different perspectives and from each point of view; we get to understand Arjun even better. For Arjun's father, his son's actions are stains on his prestige. For his friends, Arjun's actions show his recklessness and free-spirited attitude. For Preethi, Arjun's actions show his madness and unwillingness to change, which she eventually embraces.There are lot of amazing scenes in the movie which has immense depth in it.Especially the scene where Arjun rejects a guy who came to marry his friend's sister because that guy talks cheap about females.That shows the true nature of Arjun Reddy.The scene where heroine tries to calm down infuriated Arjun is one of the best scenes of the year.It's not the number of lip-locks or the use of expletives that make Arjun Reddy a brave film. What really makes it a brave film and its director, a man with guts, is that it ventures into a space Telugu cinema has dared to enter and I doubt if it will ever. It shows that any story, when told with conviction, will be accepted and celebrated.But the major drawback is its lengthy duration which is 3hr 06 min.Almost 30mins of the movie can be edited out as most of the scenes feel repetitive in second half.It is clear that director did not want to lose any detail of Arjun reddy's fictional life but he should have written some strong scenes which are entirely missing which make us feel Arjun's pain.Vijay Devarakonda stuns you with his performance which is surely award winning. The way he brings the pathos and pain in his character is something else and drives the film completely. His dialogue delivery, the aggression he shows and the emotional manner in which he showcases his love is superb.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Rama Krishna who played Arjun's friend is brilliant as he entertains with his witty dialogues reactions.Actress Shalini may not look pretty but gave good performance.Yesteryear actress Kanchana is very good in the role of free-spirited grandma.Songs are good but its the BGM which is the soul of the movie.It elevated proceedings in brilliant way.So,Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.My rating 7.5/10",4
Arjun Reddy,"The movie is all about the attitude of Arjun Reddy,his love,ambitious way,especially anger guy. In telugu industry we don't seem this kind of movies for past decades. A trend have to introuduce as of moment in telugu. Vijay Devarakonda and Direction,Story,Screenplay are the Heart of the movie. We cant take down any of these. Vijay perfection acting felt us a different guy in T'town and finally got Star crazy. Direction appreciable, new guy to industry where he puts whole heart and has given master piece to telugu people. The movie is out standing of every character so many characters relative to real life especially telangana local language used in very descent. Actress wow she is good supporter and Friend Character of Hero was impressed us so much. All elements put in the movies. only thing is Its a youth movie A Certified but all centers people loved this and smash hit this time. I hope to get so many awards and rewards to this film. Till so many appreciations from critics also. I hope so strong Vijay will be the Best actor in filmfare awards where he missed the award with pelli choopulu. Vijay acting in a failure lover character is really great much",5
Arjun Reddy,"Arjun Reddy from the starting scene tells us that this movie is not going to be a normal travel. Be it the actors looks, attitude,dialogues the movie will go places. Vijay Devarkonda kills the performance and he has perfectly executed the 3 roles in the film. The film dialogues are good it increases the engagement of the movie. The movie is a bit lengthy and they have managed to engage the audience throughout the film but in some places the melodrama becomes very low. The director needs to be appreciated for his way of telling the story and handling of emotions. Supporting cast have done their job perfectly and to sum it up Arjun Reddy is a normal story but told in a different way which will make the audience worth the money.",4
Arjun Reddy,"It's a sad feeling that you get coming out of the theater, similar to what the main protagonist experiences throughout majority of the running time of the movie (whopping 3 hours). It's sad because such an unconventional, daring,bold, courageous movie couldn't come out if the shackles of a typical mainstream climax. Wish you could erase the final few minutes of the movie and rewrite the script to something mature and inspirational. But having said that, you would have experienced something that very rarely comes out of Telugu or Indian Cinema already which deserves rich applause to mainly the director and the male lead( which I'm sure is coming).The movie just takes off from the word go where in flashbacks, we're introduced to a good looking,hot headed, topper in the final year of his medical college. He openly dares the dean, other medicos, gets violent very often and has all the habits a doctor shouldn't have. Still he is feared and revered by all. The scenes in the college where he falls for a fresher, the ragging, romance are all shot boldly with immense realism and shock value. But somehow you connect with the male lead who is his worst enemy. The director displays the same ""I care for none"" attitude throughout the film and you hardly get time to digest the new age, open and bold dialogues (majority beeped), PDAs & fights, but still you feel for the love story when it goes awry. That is where the hero and the film start a downhill course. You don't get to feel the real reason for the separation and subsequent pain, suffering, indulgence,recklessness, but that only a minor flaw because Vijay Sai makes you feel his pain and gives a character to root for even as he slides and slides into a deep pit.it is probably his best lifetime performance. The sidekick is fantastic as well even through the dark phases of drugs, alcohol, women and the rest. Alas,we don't get any perspective from the female side which is fine till out of nowhere you get a story which is unrelatable at the end. The music and background score are one of the highlights,so are the performances of all actors. The editing makes the movie overlong & repetitive. Kudos to the director to have done research about the medical field and for a very intelligent yet realistic premise which is hugely promising. It is flawed on a few counts but if you could wipe out those parts you will be thoroughly entertained.",4
Arjun Reddy,"If I would describe this movie in one word. I would describe it as RAW. Raw emotions, Raw anger, Raw jealousy. You would feel it , you would be involved in it. Props to the director and the actor Vijay Deverakonda who plays Arjun reddy. Their brilliance makes this movie amazing. A master piece in its own right to the Telugu cinema industry. The story line is believable, the characters while extreme at times come back as real people with their own flaws. While there wasn't enough depth to shalini pandey's character, It makes sense to not have it as the movie wasn't about her character. The direction is top notch. Im not a big fan of the background score but it wasn't distracting and kept me involved at the right times. Props to the actor Rahul Ramakrishna who played Shiva. We are you sometimes, in the movie, with your reaction matching mine. In an industry stale by big names, the same directors. Which prints out the same old move with a ""twist"". This is a refreshing change.",5
Chanakyan,"The plot of the movie is quite familiar : the poor man meets rich girl ..rich girl falls in love.. poor man says no ....rich girl nags on .. poor man agrees... and evil father-in-law makes life miserable for poor man.But don't let that stop you from watching the movie - it is refreshingly interesting.That is mainly because of the trio of Kamal Hassan,Thilakan and Jayaram. They fit in so well into their roles as if they were born into them. Kamal Hassan puts up an extremely brilliant performance , both as Johnson the unemployed church choir violinist and as Johnson the intelligent avenger who weaves the web around his enemy with infinite accuracy.Thilakan too puts up a great show as MadhavaMenon, the chief minister of Kerala(!)whose daughter Renu(Urmila) is in love with Johnson.He takes every trick in the book to make Johnson leave his daughter alone but as they say Love is blind ( ..and silly) and so he goes for the extreme measure .He ruins Johnson's family .. makes them commit suicide and leaves a very battered Johnson to rot in a railway track. Johnson gets a double shock as he learns that Renu committed suicide.What does he do? Unlike the ordinary hero who would either drink and die or takes up an axe to hack the villain,he decides to ruin MadhavaMenon's life slowly and steadily.He uses Jayaram to mimic Mr Menon's voice and switches his election campaign ... first on radio and then on TV .. then he makes huge withdrawals from banks from the CM's fund ... and finally traps the CM in a nail biting climax. Jayaram's love interests and Madhu as the investigating officer consist the further part of the movie. The movie Chanakyan also introduces Urmila Matonkar into filmdom but she doesn't have much to do except look pretty.And of course there is that theme music that follows Kamal Hassan around as he goes on in search of his prey.The music is simply scintillating and it makes you feel so very involved in the film. Mohan Sithara can take credit for that. Overall it is a good bet if you are interested in a good revenge-seeker film and I give it a 9/10 ( the one point taken of due to the excessive dosage of drama) and be sure to watch it on a stormy Saturday evening..",5
Chanakyan,"Fantastic movie! One of the most different revenge movies made in India. Normally, the protagonist makes use of his brawns, rather than brains to avenge the villains. Kamal himself has acted in a dozen action thrillers of the same type. But Chanakyan is a mind blowing film which handles 'revenge' in an extremely different way. Kamal, Jayaram and Thilagan have given a knock out performance. Urmila Matongkar looks gorgeous.Years after his family gets massacred by a politician, Johnson returns with a masterplan to destroy his him. The only difficulty is - his enemy is none other than the Chief minister of Kerala! Revealing more of the story isn't good...So guys, get the DVD and watch it!",5
Chanakyan,"One of the best thrillers of Indian cinema. Thats Chanakyan.Its an absolutely brilliant film. Backed by a fantastic screenplay & scintillating performances,Chanakyan is a must watch. It's a treat to watch Kamal Haasan & Thilakan perform. The film features one of the best climax ever. One of the major highlights of the film is it's background score by Mohan Sithara, which is truly exceptional. Hats off to the captain of the film T.K.Rajeev Kumar.The most shocking aspect of this film is that the producer Navodaya Appachan incurred losses owing to the origin of cassette piracy when it released.I don't mind watching this film a hundred times. It's an evergreen film which proves to be a spine chilling thriller every time you watch it !",5
Chanakyan,"This movie, dear readers, is simply an undiscovered gem. India is not known for making thrillers. The songs, dances and the melodrama combined with the poor shot-taking make our thrillers lifeless, boring and above all quite an embarrassing watch. Chanakyan, however, is something quite different. Written by Saab John and produced by the (undiscovered genius) Jojo, Chanakyan is a textbook on how to make compelling thrillers. The premise is simply brilliant. A man takes revenge on the top politician by using the services of a mimicry artist. On first glance when you read it, I am sure, it would seem ridiculous. But so do the premises of major Hollywood blockbusters. It is in the execution and crafting of the premise that the film distinguishes itself. I will not spoil the fun by revealing how it all turns out but please do watch this for its brilliance. The theme music by Mohan Sitara is simply awesome.",5
Chanakyan,'Chanakyan' has a significant relevance in Malayalam cinema and may be in Indian cinema too. It is a revenge story and first of its kind. The cinema not only reveals the acting perfection of Kamal Hassan and Thilakan but also shows how technology can be used to deceive a whole state. The film came when TV was becoming popular as a household device and Doordarshan was a strange and astonishing entertainment medium to the common people. The film boasts of using technological experiments in the content of the story which one can hardly think at that time. T.K.Rajeev Kumar surprised everyone with this film. Urmila Mandotkar made debut in malayalam with this film. Jayaram also gave a good performance.,5
