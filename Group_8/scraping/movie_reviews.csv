How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic. I would strongly suggest watching the first two installments before watching this film.Signing offSilly D'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I promise not to spoil the film below.\nThis film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film.

You will cry at the end for sure! I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, it took some time to connect with the audience. But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!! Best Dreamworks movie, and one of the best animations I've seen!""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Walking into this film I had very high expectations.The first movie, I'd watched when I was about 8 years old and I fell in love with the characters and the world behind Vikings and dragons. It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried. I've taken my kids to all 3 movies, and we've loved all of them. I must admit, I was nervous going in after watching the diabolical Wreck it Ralph 2. Was this 2nd sequel going to finish on a high?\nAbsolutely, it didn't let me down. It had heart, it had a great story and an epic finish.\nDreamworks, you've out done pixar on this one, well done!""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I went and saw this movie with my best friend and her two brothers today and I cannot stop thinking about it. It was the best way to end the franchise of my favourite movies since I was eight years old. I'm 17 now, and I still love it as much as I did then. It covers pretty much everything I hoped would happen.\nA lot of this movie was focused mainly on Toothless instead of Hiccup and he makes a lot of the decisions in this movie that Hiccup might have made in the first two films. He is also being drawn away from Hiccup after meeting the Light Fury and Hiccup starts to discover who he is without his dragon and also focus on his relationship with Astrid. Both dragon and human make impossible decisions to save their kind.\nThis movie is very emotional and gives a different vibe to the first two films and includes everything a true HTTYD would want to see. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially in the scenes were Toothless and the Light Fury are falling in love. The soundtrack is also beautiful and fits in well with the scene. There is also good character development, especially for Hiccup and Toothless, of course, and we even see a little more of a significant role in a coupe of the characters we've always known to be comedic relief.\nI was very happy with the final film in my favourite movie franchise, and I even cried a little bit in the last ten minutes. It is more dark and mature than the first two films and can therefore be loved by adults as well. Thank you so much, How to Train your Dragon franchise. You changed my life for the better.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""This film is well executed , good movie but not impressed . Don't put high expectations on this film .

The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way.\nWith the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story.\nThe animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010.\nIt contains numerous homages to the first film that will make all viewers laugh and cry alike.\nOverall, a very pleasing and emotionally affecting end to the saga with a strong emotional message about friendship'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I went in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World with high expectations. I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love\nthe score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""This is the most beautiful and amazing movie of all time!!! Even I can say that this movie is better than its previous ones, and it's much to say. I've never cried so much with a movie... It can't be better ending for this trilogy. These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are. So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.\nNow the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I love this movie as much as I loved The first two\nThe soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)\nThe friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much\nToothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together\nHiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side\nI'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes\nI love ruffnut she is so funny\nAnd the ending is beautiful it is so perfect\nWhat an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy\nThank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn\'t fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn\'t that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film\'s runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn\'t they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"".

She will like that!\nThe attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!\nAlso Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader.

I agree with the criticism I've already read on this page. Story underdeveloped, the villain extremely underwhelming... The whole movie is basically shown in the trailer. Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really. Very dissappointing.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:\nThe animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:\nThe story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.\nThey tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Dreamworks has done it agin.

It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried.

It was the best way to end the franchise of my favourite movies since I was eight years old. I'm 17 now, and I still love it as much as I did then. It covers pretty much everything I hoped would happen.\nA lot of this movie was focused mainly on Toothless instead of Hiccup and he makes a lot of the decisions in this movie that Hiccup might have made in the first two films. He is also being drawn away from Hiccup after meeting the Light Fury and Hiccup starts to discover who he is without his dragon and also focus on his relationship with Astrid. Both dragon and human make impossible decisions to save their kind.\nThis movie is very emotional and gives a different vibe to the first two films and includes everything a true HTTYD would want to see. The animation is absolutely amazing, especially in the scenes were Toothless and the Light Fury are falling in love. The soundtrack is also beautiful and fits in well with the scene. There is also good character development, especially for Hiccup and Toothless, of course, and we even see a little more of a significant role in a coupe of the characters we've always known to be comedic relief.\nI was very happy with the final film in my favourite movie franchise, and I even cried a little bit in the last ten minutes. It is more dark and mature than the first two films and can therefore be loved by adults as well. Thank you so much, How to Train your Dragon franchise.

I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love\nthe score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before.

So, they are the better of this generation. These movies will always be in my heart, and they will be my favorite FOREVER.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.\nNow the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I love this movie as much as I loved The first two\nThe soundtrack is amazing (John Powell is genius)\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous every scene looked so real and magical (this is the best animated film)\nThe friendship that hiccup and toothless have is so beautiful and I love them so much\nToothless and the light fury is so cute and adorable I love the scenes when they are together\nHiccup and Astrid relationship is awesome too I love how Much Astrid loves hiccup and how she always going to be by his side\nI'm glad that the twins (ruffnut and tuffnut) got to be in some of scenes\nI love ruffnut she is so funny\nAnd the ending is beautiful it is so perfect\nWhat an amazing way to end the the httyd Trilogy\nThank you to dean deblois,Cressida cowell,John Powell, and everyone at dreamworks who help made the httyd movies and series""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn\'t fulfil ones expectations.

The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored.

Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn\'t that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film\'s runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn\'t they have done this before?""

Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really.

By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:\nThe story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.\nThey tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise.

I did not go into this expecting a comedy, so I was not disappointed. I enjoyed Private Life. The aesthetic of Richard and Rachel\'s apartment and style was visually appealing, and I think the various moods of the story were conveyed well. Richard and Rachel, and every character, are flawed people, portrayed as such in what I consider a very accurate way. The seemingly endless loop and obsession Rachel has with getting pregnant was hard to watch because you can see her pain, and as a viewer you want to reach out to her and pull her away from the tunnel vision she has, not because of Kathryn\'s acting (which is superb as usual). Sadie\'s personality is grating at times, but that\'s because she is a real, dimensional person who has facets and flaws. The relationship between her and Richard and Rachel is what you\'re meant to focus on. The relationships between all characters is what drives the story. In the end, this is just a look into the lives of a couple who are struggling immensely with infertility. It\'s a snapshot of what their lives have become now. The ending scene, where they sit in an Applebee\'s several states over, waiting for a donor who will probably never show up (yet again) further drives this home. There\'s no happy ending or message in here. This is just a story that starts and ends in the middle. Don\'t watch this expecting gut busting laughs, or a happy ending, don\'t watch this if you ""adore New York"" and then complain that it takes place mostly in an apartment.

This doesn't really harm the film since it's gripping and frequently gives up tension and action throughout the duration.I'd say that the trailers pretty much spoiled the film. After watching the film, I really feel they shouldn't have given some integral parts in the promos because that kills the surprise factor, although the director provides another twist to cover for it. Robbie Grewal has done a decent job but he has added songs too randomly. A film like this doesn't need singing and love tracks even if short.The first half is gripping and the plotting is excellent. The interval twist is outstanding. That's the one thing I can call truly unpredictable. The second half also goes on to take the conflict further and several scenes are outstanding. I must also mention that the emotional moments are captivating from start to finish and the action sequences are also very impressively staged, most notably the chase that is all over the promos. There is, however, some extreme violence, so be warned. I could already see and hear the audience getting terrified during one such scene.John Abraham delivers a terrific act. Jackie Shroff also occasionally performs well. Mouni Roy just happens to be there. The villains are menacing and the complex relations between characters are one of the many things this film gets right. The weather depicted throughout the duration makes its presence felt.

What happens when the cover of the blue eyed boy of RAW is blown? Is he disowned by his own people? Is he just treated as a pawn in the bigger scheme of things? Does he become a liability to his own government, someone who is easily dispensable? This forms the rest of the plot.Review:\nJohn Abraham as the master of disguise (Romeo, Akbar and Walter) gets into the character with ease, displaying various emotions like fear when he is first recruited by RAW; angst, when he is disowned by his own when his cover is blown & presence of mind when he is confronted with difficult situations while trying to spy on Paki officials with ease. Really the Ace in the pack of cards.Sikandar Kher, as Col Khan from the ISI does a great job as a sadist who enjoys pulling out peoples nails as a part of the third degree torture while humming a sweet song.\nJackie as the RAW chief Srikant Rai gives a restrained performance and is one of the strongest links which binds the film together.Rest of the cast like Raghuvir Yadav, Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Mouni Roy have also done a decent job with their small but well etched out characters.Why is the film not as gripping as Raazi?Though a decent one time watch & despite dwelling in the same genre as Raazi which was an awesome film to say the least, RAW falters a bit with its lack of past paced action owing to the slow narrative inspite of a stellar cast. This is unfortunately what brings the film down by a notch when compared to Raazi which had all of the above.There is a twist in the tale at the climax but it is so far-fetched that probably even the popping out of Jim Carrey's eyes in the film MASK would seem normal to most.But to cut the makers some slack, RAW has its moments, though not enough to keep the audiences glued to their seats (I was yawning a bit in the first half due to the slow narrative). The length of the film should have been reduced by 15-20 mins.Verdict:\nA one time watch, not bad yet not too gripping for a film in this genre. I would ideally give it 6.5 stars out of 10 ......but am tempted to add half a star more for the effort put in by the makers. Watch it in the theatres without raising the bar too high and you won't be disappointed.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""ROMEO AKBAR WALTER is the story of a patriot who takes extreme risks while spying in enemy country. The year is 1971. Romeo Ali (John Abraham) works in India in a bank. He stays with his mother Waheeda (Alka Amin) who is overprotective about him since Romeo's father had died while serving the country. Romeo too has the passion to work for India but is unable to do so due to his mother. However one day he meets Shrikant Rao (Jackie Shroff), head of RAW, and he asks Romeo to join them and spy on Pakistanis on their soil. Romeo agrees and before leaving for training and eventual trip to Pakistan, he lies to his mother that he has been promoted in the bank and that that's why he has been sent for training. In Pakistan, he manages to smartly win the trust of arms dealer Isaq Afridi (Anil George), who's very close to General Zorawar (Purnendu Bhattacharya). While spying on their conversations and activities, Romeo stumbles upon an important information. The Pakistani forces are planning an air strike in Badlipur area of the then East Pakistan. This part of Pakistan is getting rebellious and wants independence. The rebels meanwhile are being trained by Indian forces and a lot of them are stationed at Badlipur, where the Pakistanis plan to drop bombs. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Robbie Grewal's story is promising and could have made for an exciting thriller. Robbie Grewal and Rahul Sen Gupta's screenplay however is very weak and flawed. The scenes don't flow well and the narrative is quite incoherent. Audiences might not be able to easily comprehend what's going on. There are too many loopholes that even a layman will be able to point out. Robbie Grewal, Ishraq Eba and Shreyansh Pandey's dialogues are well worded but nothing memorable.Robbie Grewal's direction is not upto the mark. It is evident that he has put in a lot of research but it's of no use when you are not able to use it well. Moreover, audiences won't be able to help but compare the proceedings with RAAZI and it was a far superior product. So this factor also comes in play. Except for the final scene, one doesn't root for Romeo. His bond with his mother seems half baked. Even the romantic track with Parul (Mouni Roy) seems forced. The makers don't even bother to show what happens to Parul later on.John Abraham gives his hundred per cent. The film might disappoint but he won't. His deadpan expressions work very well for his character. Mouni Roy has an interesting part to essay. Though she does well, her character gets a raw deal. Jackie Shroff is dependable but at places, it's difficult to understand what he's speaking. Sikandar Kher oozes fear and terror and gets the accent right. Suchitra Krishnamoorthi (Rehana Kazmi) is fine but has very little to do. Anil George is damn impressive. Raghubir Yadav (Mudassar) leaves a mark. Purnendu Bhattacharya is okay. Rajesh Shringapure (Awasthi) and Nawab Afridi (Shadaab Amjad Khan) do well.The music has no scope and seems forced. 'Bulleya' fails to strike a chord. 'Maa' is forcefully added. 'Vande Mataram' is played in the end credits. 'Allah Hoo Allah' is needless while 'Jee Len De' is there for just a minute. Hanif Shaikh's background score is quite loud but works in enhancing impact.Tapan Tushar Basu's cinematography is appropriate. Madhur Madhavan and Swapnil Bhalerao's production design gives the film a nice retro touch. Same goes for Ameira Punvani's costumes. The clothes worn by Mouni is in sync with the era shown. Prana and Pixel D's VFX is passable.

Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language.

Del Toro did not invent hellboy. He simply adapted the source material with his own spin. Don't get me wrong, I love the orginal two...BUT, all these negative reviews by people who are determined to hate it because of the Del toro movies is downright childish to be quite honest.Second, Harbour does a bloody fantastic job of bringing hellboy to life. While still not exactly the same as the comic hellboy, his damn close, way more so than Ron Perlmen.Now as a longstanding mega fan of the comics I can safely say this was made for the fans. It has so many utterly satisfying scenes, nods, characters and scenarios, subtle and not so subtle ripped straight from the comics. So if you're a fan of the comics , you will get that little extra bit of satsifaction.I was thoroughly entertained as both a fan and a movie goer.\nIf you dont go in expecting a oscar winning masterpiece. You're in a for one incredibly entertaining, gore filled, epic quest of a movie.

The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well.

I went to see it and to decide for myself.\n3. I like it. Most of it - Baba Yaga part.It was wow - everything - character design, environment, performance, CGI....

I ain\'t no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance.\nIf you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don\'t be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than ""copycat BARFI"" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'As a middle school teacher, I think there aren\'t many better movies for showing how 9/11 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad, and it is definitely not flag waving, but it tackles real issues, and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very, very popular in South Asia, Africa, and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions, and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama, this is not it. If you want a window in to how the rest of the world lives, views America, and how they sometimes feel left out, this is it. I have yet to have a parent, a student, or a fellow teacher watch it and say, ""blah"".'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar\'s most accomplished work to date - powerful, moving and involving. Johar seemed to have learnt a lot from the previous feedbacks he must have got for his films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija, who finally proves her talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly realistic and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places, but it never goes over-the-top and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic, which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. All these antonyms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This was really tough viewing.That\'s where our hero, Rizwan Khan, is thrown. He suffers from Asperger\'s Syndrome, he\'s different, he\'s naive, he takes every word literally, but he is intelligent and talented, and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him: the world includes only two groups of people  good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always, and it\'s easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan\'s childhood is amazing. His relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him, is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour, romance and some wonderful songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as ""Sajda"", ""Noor-E-Khuda"" and ""Tera Naina Re"". The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lip-sync in a true Hindi film style, is appreciable but I, for one, at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from Johar\'s previous films, the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much more simple, light and enjoyable. The later half introduces the post-9/11 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks and murder. Johar\'s depiction of this phase is brilliantly done. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist, and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself.Khan\'s journey in the US is extraordinary. It unfolds in several episodes, each one presenting the different people he meets on his way: a motel owner named Jitesh, a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food, a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode, however, is that of Mama Jenny and her son \'Funny Hair\' Joel from the rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is incredibly entertaining and heart-touching. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving, and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing ""We Shall Overcome"" is one of my favourite scenes in the film. That was unforgettable.Well, there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan\'s appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of many discussions, and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his finest performances. He is phenomenal. It\'s amazing to see him transforming from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and playing it with such conviction. His mannerisms, body language, tone, dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing.As expected, he is totally matched by Kajol, whose charismatic nature, easy charm, evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity, maturity and strength. As Mandira, she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural, intense and compelling as ever, playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No, I\'m not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes (which are great), but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It\'s one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor, no matter how lengthy his character is, performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan\'s caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan\'s brother Zakeer, who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother\'s mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer\'s wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira\'s friend, Sarah. Tanay Chheda is first-rate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up, My Name is Khan is a fantastic film and an altogether worthy effort. It is fascinating, entertaining and it may definitely make you look at certain things differently. It is well written, directed and performed, and is beautifully shot. Deepa Bhatia\'s editing and Ravi K. Chandran\'s cinematography are also noteworthy. Kudos to all involved. Mr and Mrs Khan rock, I highly recommend you to see their story.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'This movie I got to say is the most endearing & has some superb performances from Shahrukh and Kajol.It is undoubtedly one of the most moving & meaningful movies which has been spurned out from Bollywood.Moving away from all stereotyped roles,acting,storyline, this movie places its flag of its own.All credits to Karan Johar for telling such a complex subject in such simple words.Brilliant cinematography,direction & performance makes this film worth watching not one but many times.The characters stay with you for a long time even after you leave the theater.SRK is Awesome in his acting along with Kajol supporting her character brilliantly.SRK never for once loses his grip on the character despite playing a patient of Asperger Syndrome which is one of the most challenging role played by any Indian actor or any Hollywood actor like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.Go Watch this Soul-Tearing movie which forces you to re-think about the myths of religion,classes,communities & genders in which the human beings are classified every now & then.All this along with entertaining you all the way with some very cute funny scenes.Take the message from this movie & pass it along to everybody.This is what this movie deserves.

He may be the world\'s worst salesman but he\'s the best human being. This is Rizwan, an innocent, clean hearted, simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world; those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger\'s Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn\'t stupid, in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won\'t bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Mandira (Kajol). However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you\'ll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the Rizwan-Mandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous ""young"" love stories but he is even better in this mature, realistic portrayal of ""love at first sight"". He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit, the second half begins to become more far-fetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography, you\'ve got to give it to Ravi K Chandran, the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye, were not over-powering and used simply as a back-drop. Coming onto the extras, I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once, these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless, they are relatively unknown actors (apart from Jimmy Shergill) and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heart-felt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He\'s done it all and yet he can still leave us gob-smacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard- ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan\'s loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy, you feel happy; when he is sad, you feel sad; when he is hurt, you feel hurt; and when he is confused and lost, you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice, you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I\'m so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had, periodGo watch this film now and I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that.

It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears..

Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!!

Fox guys were really keen whether the $16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan, he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie, and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker, Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay, and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America, and as I already mentioned, if marketed properly, this one has potential to gross $20-30 million in North America alone. Having said that, being primarily a love story, it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years, the hype in India is inexplicable.

Final word? MY NAME IS KHAN is Karan, SRK and Kajol's best outing to date. Do I need to add anything more?A number of sequences are endearing. For instance, the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle, yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst  first, when her son meets with a catastrophe and second, when she confronts SRK  are truly shattering.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heard/read/watched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also, the movie states  and states very strongly, without mincing words  Not all Muslims are terrorists.There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction  exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation, he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind.

All we need to do now is wait for February 2010.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious, perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding, love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan, first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability, then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons, one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim, which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched, they only find the things he needs for his journey, identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his, although limited in some sense, understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of Hindu/Muslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life, with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister in-law who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina, this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character, beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie; the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad, no Hindu and Muslim, no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists, good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim, bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women, good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition, such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center, the wife of his brother who teaches at a college, the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan, first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources. I gained a better understanding of why in fact the Muslim faith tradition is one of love, from Khan quoting directly from the two religious books the Hadith and the Qur'an in order to reinforce the love he showed to everyone. As a further demonstration there is the scene where he travels to Wilhelmina Georgia in order to be with and help save Mama Jenny and Funny Haired Joel.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""delivers everything with simplicity... a standing ovation to SRK for the way he has acted a movie which delivers a message that humanity is everything and not religion....... people should not be judged by their religion....and u can't just stop loving Rizwan KHAN(not SRK) he has done such a wonderful work u will get lost in him....it is undoubtedly one of the finest movies to come out of Bellwood in recent years....and not only SRK everyone has done excellent work in this movie....you cannot miss the SRK-KAJOL chemistry it's so refreshing to see them together again....everyone can take it as a valentine gift....music is very good it takes the story forward and not like other Bellwood flicks in which songs are added forcefully... so in my view it's an awesome movie which is honest and simple in every aspects...""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Some love stories are built on passion, some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey. My Name Is Khan introduces us to the world of Rizwan Khan, who mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal, but his vulnerability which makes him endear-able. The audience falls in love with Rizwan because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey, that you no longer root for SRK and his victory, but for Rizwan and his belief, which makes My Name Is Khan a winner right from the opening credits.His name is Khan, Rizwan Khan. Brought up in an unforgiving society, Rizwan battles the alternate evils of racial profile and scornful peers with equal focus, trying to make sense of the world that burns homes, bullies people at school and make a false show of sympathy. He goes by the doctrine of his Ammi, who teaches him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Rizwan carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.My Name Is Khan is appreciable because of its brilliance, acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Karan Johar weaves in a tale of love, faith, religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 160 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system, through the filtered sensibilities of a patient suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, one who cannot understand the world, but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Rizwan, Karan succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.The story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film, constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising, casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Shibani Bathija is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Rizwan through his smiles and tears , laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Bollywood.In the end, My Name Is Khan becomes the experience it is because of Rizwan and Mandira, essayed flawlessly by Shahrukh and Kajol. Shahrukh exudes the spirit of Rizwan in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Rizwan , who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by Kajol whose very presence lights up the entire room with just a flashing smile. She balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Shahrukh and Kajol form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jimmy Shergil as Shahrukh's brother delivers a matured and restrained performance while Zarina Waheb as Rizwan's mother blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Tanay Chheda is exceptional as the young Rizwan in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Vinay Pathak in a dazzling cameo.There will always be movies that enchant us with their magic, but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. My Name Is Khan is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will never be one Rizwan Khan, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events.

And this is a new phenomenon that America will have to get used to, foreign film countries shooting in the USA and examining our society. For better or worse this is how we seem to many foreigners.Shakrukh Khan creates a character in Rizwan Khan that many Americans will recognize if they've seen Being There, Rainman, and Forrest Gump. Bits from all those films will be found in My Name Is Khan. Khan is a Moslem citizen of India who emigrates to the USA and finds love and happiness when he weds a mother with a son from a previous marriage the wife played by Kajol and the stepson by Yurgon Makaar. She's Hindu, but the different faiths don't seem to matter. Khan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and its challenge enough for him to make his way in the world without picking up on the subtle nuances of the differences of religions and why one group has to hate all the others.All this changes on September 11, 2001 when some fanatical Moslems hijack some airlines and change the course of history forever crashing them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and killing a lot of innocent people, including a few hundred Moslems by all counts of the victims. As in the past here and other places bad behavior by some inflicted a stigma on the group.Young Mr. Makaar is killed in a hate crime incident which changes Khan's relationship with his mother and Khan himself through a combination of circumstances gets on a terrorist watch list. Khan conceives a mission to tell the President of the United States be it George W. Bush or Barack Obama that he is not a terrorist. Both in my professional and family heritage I've got some history with these kind of events. In my former job with Crime Victims Board I had a claim involving a bias attack against a young Arab American boy the same age as Mr. Makaar. It was only when I questioned the young man and his parents I learned of the bias nature of the events. Together with the GLBT liaison with the Kings County District Attorney we went to the Bias Unit of the NYPD and got the case reclassified as a bias attack. Sad though that no one was ever arrested for the crime, but it wasn't for lack of trying here. This was during the years immediately following the first Iraqi War and there was an upswing of attacks on Moslem Americans then as well.After World War I, we had the Palmer Raids in which the Bill of Rights was torn up and under the Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer many suspected radicals of Jewish or Slavic origins were deported in wholesale lots. I had a grand uncle on my mother's side who had such radical politics and he missed being deported by a hair. This was after the Russian Revolution and a number of anarchist bombings including the Morgan Bank on Wall Street and a mail bomb sent to the Attorney General himself. Duly elected Socialist members of the New York State Legislature were expelled at this time. It was not a good era.In the tradition of Peter Sellers, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks, Shahrukh Khan might have an Oscar or nomination at least in his future. Two Magic Kingdom regulars from their teen shows have parts in this, Shane Harper of Good Luck Charlie plays one of the bashers and and Kenton Duty of Shake It Up playing the best friend who turns on Yurgon Makaar show far more acting chops in this than on the Disney Channel.There is no excuse or reason, no justification at all to make war on children. If you want to fight terrorists there's a war now in Afghanistan and probably future wars for the USA unless both we get it right and certain Moslems realize they are not taking the world over for Allah. Ditto the Christians who want to win the world for Jesus. We all have to live together and secular humanism may yet save us all.And this review is dedicated to the late Liz Garro of the Kings County District Attorney's office, the late John Lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived in the USA until his 90s, and to Ziad Abdel-Dayem of Brooklyn who last I heard is a married man.

In other words, the movie and its emotional experience entirely belongs to Kajol, for her outstanding performance and Karan, for his unexpectedly hard hitting & thoughtful direction.It right away starts off with the already famous scene of Shahrukh\'s interrogation at the airport and then keeps on moving into a series of flashbacks. The first half has a slow pace and is more or less predictable. Still, the subtle scenes between Shahrukh & Kajol are nicely written and finely executed. However the scene where Shahrukh shows Kajol, the city from a hill top is quite similar to the one in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"". Besides this, the childhood sequences of Khan\'s life, lack the required depth and could have been much better.The real action starts post intermission, which also leads to major glitches in the screenplay. The sequences where Shahrukh is travelling through various places, meeting variety of people is a bit lengthy also highly inspired from Tom Hank\'s ""Forrest Gump"". Actually as the main emphasis shifts onto the theme of meeting the President, the film takes an unexpected turn and goes over the top to some extent. The un-necessary focus on media coverage and political references takes away the emotional essence of the story, making the viewer a little uninterested.To be precise there are three strong merits in MNIK.1. One is the amazingly natural and highly expressive performance by Kajol. In fact I would like to rate Kajol\'s emotional scene with her son, as one of best ever tragedy scenes in Hindi Films till date. The sequence reminded me of an equally great hospital scene of ""Sharaabi"".2. Second is the director Karan Johar, who surprisingly returns with a more realistic, dark and controversial subject, completely in contrast with all of his previous projects.3. Third and the most important merit of the movie is its solid and hard-hitting message to the world that ""Everyone in a particular religion or community cannot and should not be punished for the inhuman crimes committed by a few people of the same origin."" Coming back to Shahrukh Khan, the hard work is clearly visible and the effort is quite admirable. Shahrukh no doubt comes up with a noticeable performance as The Khan. But truly speaking, there are undeniable glimpses of Dustin Hoffman & Sean Penn, clearly visible in his autistic act. Khan\'s performance will surely impress millions of his Bollywood fans who love watching only Hindi Films. But for the movie buffs who are well familiar with Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"", Sean Penn in ""I am Sam"" and Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump""\x85\x85., Shahrukh has simply done a good job. He visibly tries hard to move away from all the above references and does come up with a fine performance. But the impact of all the above three names in their respective roles is so huge that it unintentionally leads you to a comparison.In addition to this, the writing also shows some major faults in the screenplay. For instance, I am still not able to figure out that which Hindu-Muslim Riots happened in 1983 in Mumbai. Secondly, in the few initial scenes, it\'s shown that Shahrukh has a serious problem with Yellow color. Yet in the second half he is shown holding a yellow cardboard in his hand.Lastly in the final hour, everything just goes on happening so easily, which completely contradicts the realistic feel of the movie and lessens its final impact on the viewer. The movies also raises a question that why Karan approved of making ""Kurbaan"" on a similar subject of 9/11 impact on Muslims in America, when he was himself making MNIK on the same subject? Apart from the impressive Kajol act, Jimmy Shergil excels in his few scenes and so does Sonya Jehan who plays Jimmy\'s wife. Parveen Dabbas shines as a Sikh who opts for cutting his hair after 9/11 in order to survive the hate attacks. Both Vinay Pathak and Zareena Wahab make their presence felt in their small roles.Cinematography is great with some new unexplored locations looking fresh on screen. But I found Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy\'s music lacking the melody part once again. However, Karan very intelligently, uses only few full length songs in the movie and rest of them are just there as a part of the background music.Summing up, ""MNIK"" is surely one of those few good movies which are capable of raising a question and starting a debate. Many of the viewers might miss the regular glossy & romantic feature of a Shahrukh-Karan film. But MNIK is a clear indication of changing times in Bollywood and should be taken in good spirits.It\'s not a perfect piece of art but a laudable effort indeed from Dharma Productions.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie. At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important. Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'. As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels. The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact. We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad. Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill). One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan. Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected. When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.' Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found. Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe. There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet. Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll. Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol. Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth!

The jokes and skits were often pathetic but the music was pretty good and the band members (all ten of them) always seemed to be having a good time. They never took themselves too seriously and weren\'t above making fun of themselves. Bowzer was the leader and always closed the show by going ""Do-Do-Do-Do"" over and over while making muscles, which was a joke as he was pretty skinny and barely had any muscle. The guests were often from the 50s/60s era but once in awhile, they had more current guests like the Ramones and Kim Carnes. A show like this would never be made today, even with contemporary music stars but looking back, Sha Na Na was pretty fun to watch.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Sha Na Na were a group of Columbia University students who formed in 1968 and rose to popularity after performing at Woodstock, but it was their appearance in the blockbuster success GREASE that led to the creation of this variety show built around the band. The comedy sketches performed by the band were all based in a 50\'s ""West Side Story"" reality (on a sound stage) and in front of an ""almost live"" audience. Likely formulated to cash in on the 50\'s revival movement begun with American GRAFITI and HAPPY DAYS, it\'s perhaps surprising that it lasted as long as it did -a brief three and a half seasons. It may not have been as professional as Donnie & Marie or even the Mandrell Sisters, but what it lacked in budget it more than made up for in chutzpah. The ""greaser"" styled ensemble did a fair job on the comedy, which clicked mostly with youngsters, but the real highlight of this regional weekly program was the music., which appealed to older audiences nostalgic for the uncomplicated rock \'n roll music of the 50s.The band always performed at least one song in a straight-forward live manner, and usually several other songs throughout the program during the comedy vignettes (ala the Monkees). The writing was simple (perhaps even juvenile) but entertaining, as the program\'s target audience was probably also watching the (superior) Muppet Show, and the (inferior) Hudson Brothers, and Sha Na Na fit neatly between the two in terms of quality, and provided an alternative to the nursing home muzak of Lawrence Welk. The breakout star of the group was Jon ""Bowzer"" Bauman, whose basso profondo vocal register was so low as to be a novelty in and of itself. He went on to numerous acting roles and game show gigs. The television show helped the band sell a handful of records, and bushels of live concert tickets throughout its late 70\'s / early 80\'s run. For better or worse, Sha Na Na served as a cultural bridge for the generation between the New York Dolls (with whom they shared the Filmore East stage on more than one occasion) and new wave; it\'s hard to imagine the success of rockabilly revivalists The Stray Cats, without giving a little credit to the relentlessly touring Sha Na Na.

Satyajit Ray, the legendary director, masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas, a legend of the Calcutta stage. (An interesting aside -- ""chhabi"" is Bengali for ""picture"" and ""biswas"" means ""belief."") He fit the mold of a classic actor -- temperamental, undependable, a raging alcoholic, a master.

Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the pre-independence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindarsa dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur\'s glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray\'s fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijitothe finally film in Ray\'s much acclaimed ""The Apu Trilogy"". Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film, based on some popular work of literature, which would incorporate popular Indian music. But, what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an art-house work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian box-office. But, it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie\'s dark and gloomy tone. The movie\'s melancholic musical composition and sombre art directionthe sublime use of mirrors, chandeliers, etc.gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American Film-Noir films of the \'40s and \'50s.In Jalsaghar, Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that, having stood the test of time for over five decades, continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray\'s most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray\'s oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray\'s films, especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But, a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thought-provoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema.

As with the Apu trilogy, I am mesmerized and absorbed by the pacing and drama of the film. Even though the film uses music, its appreciation, and its status as the vehicle for its themes, there is no (or very little?) background music for the spoken portions of the film.  This provides not only realism, but sets off the intense and magnificent performance of the protagonist.  There is also a great deal of entertainment in this film: the music performances are excellent.  I wonder if Ray found the best musicians of the region and gave them roles as performers in the musical soirees: performers playing performers.  I have the sense that there is very little artifice in the cinematography.  That is, I feel that the filming techniques were not highly sophisticated.  But the eye, the light, the composition are almost perfect. I think that the other commenter (the only other one!) stated the themes quite well for me.

There are parallels to Chekhov and Faulkner (Snopeses and Sartorises). The black and white images (the white horse!) are stunning.

It\'s also about the transformative affect of music, of which there is much and all of it wonderful. Although you might say it destroys him Biswambhar is also redeemed by opening up his music room for one last great concert.This is also one of the cinema\'s greatest studies of obsession and of loneliness.

Bresson replied -"" Satyajit\'s Ray\'s \'The Music Rom\'. An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.""""The Music Room"" is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray\'s devotion to a single mood: elegiac. Ray isn\'t alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy, cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee\'s short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film, making music, rather being an interlude, an integral part of the screenplay. In ""Jalsaghar or The Music Room"", Ray examines the age-old conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree, between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated ""Apu Trilogy"",Ray explores how one man\'s need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It\'s a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth.Set in the 1930\'s with the emerging nouveau rich, Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs, stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert, a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone, as are other subjects (his dog, horse, elephant). The film begins with the elderly Zamindar (landlord) sitting alone, staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 15-20 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar, with his young son Khoka and wife Padma (the realist/pragmatist to Huzar\'s idealism) was the class of his region, hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar\'s centerpiece, his ivory tower and final refuge from the external reality/realism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar\'s pride, his heirloom, his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially, in concentric circles, from the outer oasis, to the backyard pool/yard, to the mansion, to the music room and further yet, the music room\'s stage. Likewise Mitra\'s camera often, and nearly always in relation to Roy, dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him, but counterpoints the film\'s maze-like construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra\'s cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere. "" Music Room"" is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots (the insect dying in the glass, the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river, the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room, the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur\'s states of mind , and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait) and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film\'s maze-like construction and Roy being trapped in his past. ""The Music Room"" remains as a majestic masterpiece of a man\'s monumental effort to cling to his illustrious legacy and hold his head high when his feet wither.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Glorious filmmaking, a spellbinding morality tale of pride.

Jalsaghar tells the gloomy tale of a landlord living in Bengal whom has just lost his wife and beloved son in a horrid boating accident. The landlord, Roy (Chhabi Biswas), takes to a basic role of silence and mourning by spending his days sitting aside his hookah to pass the time. Biswas is exceptional in his performance of Roy by revealing a side to the character of near-perfect emptiness in a human being; he shows us what the empty body of a man can become.The film is a decorative wonder to watch and hear to any degree. A graceful and vivid use of cinematography brings out the rich and sweeping palace in which Roy spends his time. Various close-ups of chandeliers and jewelry create a montage of empty wealth. Later on in the film when we are introduced to the many performances which will be carried out in the landlord's music room, the film comes full circle as an audio delight as well. Beautiful Hindu compositions are performed in full length throughout sweeping-music video like coverage scanning the pitch-perfect vocalists on to the unique Indian instruments tooting away. As the music grows to inspire Roy to overcome his grief, we grow along with Roy and feel the inspiration of the songs as well.Despite its depressing subject matter, Jalsaghar is a great delight throughout its in entire runtime. Sympathizing with the victimized Roy as well as his loyal and motivational subjects, you will really overcome an exquisite experience as the characters try to pick Roy's spirits up through words, song, and dance.

On the positive side, what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting, as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating, not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too, capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood, however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes, such as the fireworks, but the feel they generally provide is graininess, which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together, rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes, such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter, tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters, all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed, but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall, what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece, and maybe it is, but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge.

What I glean from it, is a cautionary tale about how we live our lives, to have passion, and to share it openly with our loved ones and not to neglect them for pettiness. The film is amazing as a cautionary tale, but I felt it could have shown some form of redemption in the end, rather than racing out to regain something, out of fear for his own mortality, more so a sense of humility and love for his family he lost, neglected all that time...

Actually, you cannot really say that this film is a defense of the cast system but it is also not an attack on it. To attack the music in this film and call it noise is, I admit, to put your chin out. Real music is a mystery not something that you dance to. The mystery is how music can make a better human being of somebody, who, through the music, reaches feelings, so overwhelmed by goodness and humility, that they sweep all that is evil out of a person as far as that person allows it and, indeed, experience the music.For sure (and that is why it is always provoking to attack any noise calling itself music) the mystery is not solved, so that you can tell why this music makes you feel and why this other music does not make you feel. The part that has to do with memories can easily be sorted out and leave the mystery intact. This does not mean that the mystery cannot be solved or, if it is solved, is solved in such a way that it ceases to be a mystery, which is expected by any solution of a mystery. We may understand a lot about why music makes us feel what we feel and still not be able to invent new music after some kind of formula. The kind of music that is done after formula will maybe make us dance but will not make us touch God.When judging music, I judge the feelings awoken by it. People may call themselves music lovers and, for sure, have a music library that in quantity is most impressive but when they talk about music it is obvious that they understand something quite different to what those understand who cry to music because it is so moving. Maybe that is the most evident sign of a music lover, crying to music because being deeply moved, but it is, by no means, a sure sign, because swines can also cry when they are not allowed to be as swinish as they want to be. On the whole though, you can start your investigations with those who cry to music to come closer to understand the mystery of music.The music (noise) presented in this film is not something you cry to unless you have childhood memories connected to the music. It is a music however, that easily puts you in a hypnotic state in which some interesting experiences are possible as, for instance, a deeper understanding of Indian way of life. But, unless this way of life makes you cry per se, you will not cry to this kind of music and only to its lyrics, if these are touching enough.In all honesty, I would now have to name music that has touched me to tears (so that I can be attacked in turn). I will have to choose music without lyrics because that is what all this is about. Therefore it will be classical music.The Unfinished Symphony by Schubert. The Fifth Piano Concerto by Beethoven (not all movements). The Sixth Symphony by Beethoven (not all movements) Interlude from Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni Nessun Dorma (I don't know Italian so I put it here in spite of lyrics) \x85 and much more but not more than 20 hours of music at the most through out the history of man. Allowing lyrics to the music, the number of hours is, of course, much larger.Back to the film. Well, it left me rather cold, i'm afraid. I have no sympathy for the rich.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""There are many places where this film could have ended, and it would have been a better film, such as (a) after the storm, (b) with the house in ruins, even (c) after the triumphant final performance. Instead, after a mostly serious film, an absurd ending is quickly tacked on, insulting the audience.Since so many people are promoting this film, I'm going to dwell on the negative, although keep in mind that I do think it's worth watching.Among the several weaknesses of the film are: (1) the man's relationship to his wife/courtesan is not made clear. She appears out of nowhere, has a few scenes, and disappears never to be seen again. but we're told she survived the trip. (2) the man's relationship to his son, whom he seems to genuinely miss when he's gone, although perhaps more out of a blood-line legacy thing than a personal relationship. (3) everyone's relationship to the nouveau-riche down the block is unclear -- why do they attack his car? Why doesn't he initially like the music? Is he just as lazy as the hero of our story? A particular annoyance is the filmmaker's determination to dwell on every last note of the very grating and entirely unnecessary music. It doesn't move the plot. It doesn't reveal character. It does set the scene, which is good. But in some cases, particularly during the dance, the singing and instruments are heard even though the singers and musicians are clearly not making noise. Anyway, the music is local flavour, and we get the point after a few minutes. We don't need to be drowned in it. I learned on IMDb that portions of the vocalizations were not words, and that's why they had no subtitles. As closed captions often do, the subtitling should have told us this, so we know that we aren't missing any meaning.I'm ambivalent about the storm. It's described as a cyclone (at least in the English subtitles) which it clearly is not. We have summer storms that look like that where I live on a regular basis, and they're nothing. Yet, I also applaud the use of what appears to be actual lightning in a film. That's pretty rare, and should be encouraged.Despite all that, it's still a good story of obsession, bigotry, and entitlement, living in a past that most could not afford.For what it's worth, and not to say these are reasonable comparisons, but the films that came to my mind watching this one were: any of the Grey Gardens films, and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).""}]"

Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the pre-independence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindarsa dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur\'s glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray\'s fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijitothe finally film in Ray\'s much acclaimed ""The Apu Trilogy"". Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film, based on some popular work of literature, which would incorporate popular Indian music. But, what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an art-house work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian box-office. But, it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie\'s dark and gloomy tone. The movie\'s melancholic musical composition and sombre art directionthe sublime use of mirrors, chandeliers, etc.gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American Film-Noir films of the \'40s and \'50s.In Jalsaghar, Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that, having stood the test of time for over five decades, continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray\'s most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray\'s oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray\'s films, especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But, a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thought-provoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema.

As with the Apu trilogy, I am mesmerized and absorbed by the pacing and drama of the film. Even though the film uses music, its appreciation, and its status as the vehicle for its themes, there is no (or very little?) background music for the spoken portions of the film.  This provides not only realism, but sets off the intense and magnificent performance of the protagonist.  There is also a great deal of entertainment in this film: the music performances are excellent.  I wonder if Ray found the best musicians of the region and gave them roles as performers in the musical soirees: performers playing performers.  I have the sense that there is very little artifice in the cinematography.  That is, I feel that the filming techniques were not highly sophisticated.

It\'s also about the transformative affect of music, of which there is much and all of it wonderful. Although you might say it destroys him Biswambhar is also redeemed by opening up his music room for one last great concert.This is also one of the cinema\'s greatest studies of obsession and of loneliness.

An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.""""The Music Room"" is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray\'s devotion to a single mood: elegiac. Ray isn\'t alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy, cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee\'s short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation, Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film, making music, rather being an interlude, an integral part of the screenplay. In ""Jalsaghar or The Music Room"", Ray examines the age-old conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree, between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated ""Apu Trilogy"",Ray explores how one man\'s need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It\'s a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth.Set in the 1930\'s with the emerging nouveau rich, Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs, stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert, a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone, as are other subjects (his dog, horse, elephant). The film begins with the elderly Zamindar (landlord) sitting alone, staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 15-20 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar, with his young son Khoka and wife Padma (the realist/pragmatist to Huzar\'s idealism) was the class of his region, hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar\'s centerpiece, his ivory tower and final refuge from the external reality/realism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar\'s pride, his heirloom, his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially, in concentric circles, from the outer oasis, to the backyard pool/yard, to the mansion, to the music room and further yet, the music room\'s stage. Likewise Mitra\'s camera often, and nearly always in relation to Roy, dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him, but counterpoints the film\'s maze-like construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra\'s cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere. "" Music Room"" is a very visual film -- there are numerous ingenious shots (the insect dying in the glass, the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river, the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room, the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur\'s states of mind , and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait) and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film\'s maze-like construction and Roy being trapped in his past.

The landlord, Roy (Chhabi Biswas), takes to a basic role of silence and mourning by spending his days sitting aside his hookah to pass the time. Biswas is exceptional in his performance of Roy by revealing a side to the character of near-perfect emptiness in a human being; he shows us what the empty body of a man can become.The film is a decorative wonder to watch and hear to any degree. A graceful and vivid use of cinematography brings out the rich and sweeping palace in which Roy spends his time. Various close-ups of chandeliers and jewelry create a montage of empty wealth. Later on in the film when we are introduced to the many performances which will be carried out in the landlord's music room, the film comes full circle as an audio delight as well. Beautiful Hindu compositions are performed in full length throughout sweeping-music video like coverage scanning the pitch-perfect vocalists on to the unique Indian instruments tooting away.

On the positive side, what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting, as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating, not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too, capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood, however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes, such as the fireworks, but the feel they generally provide is graininess, which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together, rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes, such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter, tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters, all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed, but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall, what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece, and maybe it is, but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge.

This 1958 story is remarkably subtle, about the advancing age and declining wealth of a higher caste Indian man, a Zamindar (landlord), whose income from his inherited lands is dropping from the previous levels of his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property and income. He\'s unable to adjust his manner of living to either that change or simultaneous changes in the Indian economy that lead to new economic benefits and social mobility for many in lower castes. He\'s especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes from money lending rather than through inherited property and wealth; he engages in expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford and these leave him even poorer. Through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married and had a son (16? 18?); both wife and son died together on a trip. So he\'s alone for many years. While Indian music is his primary comfort (played in ""the music room"" of his palatial home), he also begins to use it as his primary club against his ""upstart"" neighbor. As he ages we see his memory decline, e.g., asking one of his two remaining servants, ""What month is this?"" before he presents one last concert for invited guests (and to belittle his rival, his lower caste neighbor, an included guest) before he then embarks on an activity which leads to his death. Great examples of Indian music (but the closed captions on the DVD we saw had white type/lettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background). The movie also very subtly raises the question -- to what extent is this person (one\'s self or relative or friend) going through parallel sequences in the getting old process?'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Depicts the end days of a decadent zamindar (landlord) in Bengal, and his efforts to uphold his family prestige even when faced with economic adversity.After the box office failure of ""Aparajito"", Ray desperately needed a hit film and decided to make a film based on both a popular piece of literature and a film that would incorporate Indian music. It was the first film to extensively incorporate classical Indian music and dancing.For the life of me, I haven\'t found an Indian film -- classic or contemporary -- that I really liked.

What I glean from it, is a cautionary tale about how we live our lives, to have passion, and to share it openly with our loved ones and not to neglect them for pettiness. The film is amazing as a cautionary tale, but I felt it could have shown some form of redemption in the end, rather than racing out to regain something, out of fear for his own mortality, more so a sense of humility and love for his family he lost, neglected all that time...

Actually, you cannot really say that this film is a defense of the cast system but it is also not an attack on it. To attack the music in this film and call it noise is, I admit, to put your chin out. Real music is a mystery not something that you dance to. The mystery is how music can make a better human being of somebody, who, through the music, reaches feelings, so overwhelmed by goodness and humility, that they sweep all that is evil out of a person as far as that person allows it and, indeed, experience the music.For sure (and that is why it is always provoking to attack any noise calling itself music) the mystery is not solved, so that you can tell why this music makes you feel and why this other music does not make you feel. The part that has to do with memories can easily be sorted out and leave the mystery intact. This does not mean that the mystery cannot be solved or, if it is solved, is solved in such a way that it ceases to be a mystery, which is expected by any solution of a mystery. We may understand a lot about why music makes us feel what we feel and still not be able to invent new music after some kind of formula. The kind of music that is done after formula will maybe make us dance but will not make us touch God.When judging music, I judge the feelings awoken by it. People may call themselves music lovers and, for sure, have a music library that in quantity is most impressive but when they talk about music it is obvious that they understand something quite different to what those understand who cry to music because it is so moving. Maybe that is the most evident sign of a music lover, crying to music because being deeply moved, but it is, by no means, a sure sign, because swines can also cry when they are not allowed to be as swinish as they want to be. On the whole though, you can start your investigations with those who cry to music to come closer to understand the mystery of music.The music (noise) presented in this film is not something you cry to unless you have childhood memories connected to the music. It is a music however, that easily puts you in a hypnotic state in which some interesting experiences are possible as, for instance, a deeper understanding of Indian way of life. But, unless this way of life makes you cry per se, you will not cry to this kind of music and only to its lyrics, if these are touching enough.In all honesty, I would now have to name music that has touched me to tears (so that I can be attacked in turn). I will have to choose music without lyrics because that is what all this is about. Therefore it will be classical music.The Unfinished Symphony by Schubert. The Fifth Piano Concerto by Beethoven (not all movements). The Sixth Symphony by Beethoven (not all movements) Interlude from Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni Nessun Dorma (I don't know Italian so I put it here in spite of lyrics) \x85 and much more but not more than 20 hours of music at the most through out the history of man. Allowing lyrics to the music, the number of hours is, of course, much larger.Back to the film. Well, it left me rather cold, i'm afraid. I have no sympathy for the rich.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""There are many places where this film could have ended, and it would have been a better film, such as (a) after the storm, (b) with the house in ruins, even (c) after the triumphant final performance. Instead, after a mostly serious film, an absurd ending is quickly tacked on, insulting the audience.Since so many people are promoting this film, I'm going to dwell on the negative, although keep in mind that I do think it's worth watching.Among the several weaknesses of the film are: (1) the man's relationship to his wife/courtesan is not made clear. She appears out of nowhere, has a few scenes, and disappears never to be seen again. but we're told she survived the trip. (2) the man's relationship to his son, whom he seems to genuinely miss when he's gone, although perhaps more out of a blood-line legacy thing than a personal relationship. (3) everyone's relationship to the nouveau-riche down the block is unclear -- why do they attack his car? Why doesn't he initially like the music? Is he just as lazy as the hero of our story? A particular annoyance is the filmmaker's determination to dwell on every last note of the very grating and entirely unnecessary music. It doesn't move the plot. It doesn't reveal character. It does set the scene, which is good. But in some cases, particularly during the dance, the singing and instruments are heard even though the singers and musicians are clearly not making noise. Anyway, the music is local flavour, and we get the point after a few minutes. We don't need to be drowned in it. I learned on IMDb that portions of the vocalizations were not words, and that's why they had no subtitles. As closed captions often do, the subtitling should have told us this, so we know that we aren't missing any meaning.I'm ambivalent about the storm. It's described as a cyclone (at least in the English subtitles) which it clearly is not. We have summer storms that look like that where I live on a regular basis, and they're nothing. Yet, I also applaud the use of what appears to be actual lightning in a film. That's pretty rare, and should be encouraged.Despite all that, it's still a good story of obsession, bigotry, and entitlement, living in a past that most could not afford.For what it's worth, and not to say these are reasonable comparisons, but the films that came to my mind watching this one were: any of the Grey Gardens films, and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).""}]"

The first episode was slow with little depth to the characters. I had a hard time learning the names, only remembering Annie and Jimmy. There was potential for humor, but the writers quickly dropped it and moved on. The bad guy was admittedly an interesting person. I do like how the show creates sympathy for the criminals as well as the victims. And the show did have a lot of action, which kept me awake enough to finish it. It also was enough to get me to turn it on again for the second episode.I'm glad I gave it a second chance. While there was still not a whole lot of character development, we did learn a little about our heroes. I'm still not sure on some of the names, but I did see the supporting characters more in this episode. There was more humor, though somewhat dry. And once again, the bad guy was the best and most developed character in the whole plot.You almost wanted to sympathize with him more than the good guys and the victims.

For example if you watched The Forgotten (by CSI producer Jerry Bruckheimer and also producer of this show), maybe you could find Christian Slater as a reference but not much more than that, and it was a very good show. Or The Beast, with Patrick Swayze, and you could find another good surprise there. Good shows with many people not so famous, not so charismatic. And I think that in Chase you have some chance of finding some good moments. Maybe if the show goes well you can connect with the cast. That option lays on good stories for the future.

Meanwhile Annie tracks down the bad guys, and often, when possible... shoots them dead. So let us sum of the moral compass of this ""family show"" as another reviewer termed it. Bad guys sometimes do really bad things, so it\'s a good thing when they die, and even better if you can shoot them.I do feel the aims and intentionality of the show\'s protagonists are just, but to worry over the sexual content? Really? By the way, two members of the team are sleeping with each other, and the two main leads, Annie and Jimmy, are growing ever-closer to the detriment of Jimmy\'s already-strained marriage.

I lost interest almost immediately and actually stopped watching after only five episodes, so my response may not be the most accurate description, for all I know, the show kicked up after those five episodes, but for me, it already was doomed to fail, and I was not in the least bit surprised when it was canceled. Now, I like procedurals, so my opinion isn\'t based on the idea that it should have been a more serialized drama. However, there are ways that procedurals can be good, but Chase had too many flaws for that to ever happen.Flaw #1: The plot structureThe structure itself was nice in that the show wasn\'t a \'whodunit\' kind of show, rather it let you know exactly who was being hunted and even showed scenes with the villain throughout the entire show, which, I\'ll admit is a nice change from the norm. However, where this failed was the way the supposed villains were written. With the exception of two episodes, the villains were actually written in a good light. They were three dimensional characters thatwhile they did horrible thingsthey had a good heart in different ways. The episode that really brought this to light was the fifth episode, ""Above the Law."" By the end of the episode, I was actually annoyed with the Marshalls for arresting the bad guy. Actually, on more than one occasion, I felt like I was rooting for the bad guy to win, which is not really a tactic a crime procedural should take. Unless, of course the point of the show was to make the bad guys the real heroes of the show, in which case it did a pretty decent job at that.Flaw #2: Annie FrostAnnie was probably the least likable character on the show, and given the fact that she was actually the main character, that\'s not a good thing. But probably the biggest problems with Annie was that A.) she was unrealistically good and always seemed to manage to take down the bad guy single-handedly, but B.) She was too reckless. In one episode, for example, her team is in the middle of a shootout with an incredibly dangerous killer. She sees him stop to reload his weapon. Common sense tells me that what she should have done was tell her team to move in, guns drawn and ready to shoot, before he has the chance to finish. If he doesn\'t, shoot him. Nobody would miss him. But instead, she puts her gun away and charges him to duke it out. It was incredibly reckless and could have gotten herself killed, and in the long run, could very well get her team killed. That is not a character trait you want your lead character to have. And what makes the whole situation is that her partner calls her out on it. But instead of actually listening to him, she accuses him of planning to tell the team about her father, or some other bull crap, I honestly lost interest in that storyline relatively quickly (which is actually the third flaw). Despite the fact that he told her on numerous occasions that his problems weren\'t about her father and, in fact, about her death wish, she kept going back to her same argument, which just makes her even more unlikeable. It also brings us to;Flaw #3: Annie\'s father storylineThe difference between proceduralsand even character driven proceduralsand character dramas is that the fundamental plot of the procedural is to solve the case, whether it be finding a murderer or finding out what\'s wrong with a medical patient, while a character drama pretty much tells the story of the characters. As such, the dramas can shove a lot of back-story into the characters from the get go and get away with it, they are, after all, the main purpose to the story. With a crime procedural, the audience doesn\'t have to know everything about the character from the start, but it can be gradually included over time. We know who the characters are, what they do and how they act and as the story goes on, we get better acquainted with the whys: Why they do what they do and why they act the way they act, etc. But with Chase, Annie\'s back-story with her father is used as a subplot throughout just about every episode (at least the ones I saw) to the point that I didn\'t care anymore. I didn\'t know the character enough to be that invested in her back-story, and I didn\'t even like her enough to care about how bad it was. Quite honestly, the fact that the argument with her partner, Jimmy (played by Cole Hauser who was actually pretty likable in this show), somehow managed to revolve around her father just enforced my problems. It was like the show-runners wanted people to be aware of Annie\'s daddy issues and wanted us to sympathize with her, but in reality, it just made her look dumb. The whole plot line was so contrived and forced upon us. I actually tried to watch the sixth episode and ended up turning it off after five minutes and never turned it back on, strictly because of this plot point. Chase, I imagine could have worked, but these major flaws pretty much guaranteed that it wouldn\'t last.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""People have said here, the characters are condescending and arrogant towards the public at large  I would say the same for the people who produce this steaming pile of\x85. Admittedly I only got as far as episode two  and that was enough! There is no point having a story with a villain who kills people by stabbing them in the neck if you can't show any live blood. Nor can you have a lead character standing over a victim asking for a medic while allowing the person to potentially bleed out - or that is what you would expect would happen in any other show. In another scene where the villain is racing/chasing another car, one shot of the other car shows serious damage to the side of the car, in the next it doesn't.I'm afraid the characters are just not likable I really expected more from a production that bears Jerry Bruckheimers name!""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'This woman don\'t know how to act, she must be used as a stunt.

She certainly is hot (maybe a bit scrawny) and can wear boots well, but come on, she ain't no Chuck Norris. The plot lines are totally predictable and rehashed from other shows.

This is traditional police procedural. Good or bad... this is Kelli Giddish's show. She's driving this show. The most notable thing about her is her smaller stature. She doesn't look like somebody who can take down muscle bound criminals. Early on, she has a big fight with a fugitive. Parts of it just look staged. Luckily she has the cop mannerism down. Maybe that's why she'd get Law & Order: SVU later on. This also stars Cole Hauser and Jesse Metcalfe.The main problem was it never nailed down what the show should look like. It has Kelli Giddish as a tough cop lead and pretty face Jesse Metcalfe. It seems to suggest a light weight cop show, but then they put in all kinds of action. It's certainly not gritty enough to be serious. It needs to be better.""}]"

ABCD: American Born Confused Desi,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""ABCD gives out a bad impression from its posters and trailer. But, it has more than meets the eye and I am transfixed with the base, the story and the plot.Starting with the two lead brats, it goes on to tell you the tale of how they manage their lives in Kerala, India after being born and brought up in New York. What is surprising is that every thing they do is unpredictable. The viewers will predict something else and the next sequence will totally be different. That is the charm of ABCD in the first half. Second half takes a narrow political turn, but is funnier as well. Both halves wonderfully frame the current affairs in Kerala and how the people there need only an inkling to create brouhaha.Performances are great. Jacob Gregory pulls it off very well and he is the funnier guy. Dulquer Salman acts over-cool, but he's okay. Lalu Alex is very sharp while the lead actress has equivocal stances. Music is catchy & apt but I have heard many of the tunes before. Score is inventive. Editing is fine, so is the direction.The running time of 170 minutes makes us question the intentions of the makers, and with the climax so cold, it felt like it ended abruptly. I had expected a more unconventional turn of twists. But, overall, ABCD scores!BOTTOM LINE: Fresh writing delivers chewable entertainment stuff.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Strong | Nudity/Sex: No | Vulgarity: Mild | Violence: Strong | Gore: No | Smoking: Mild | Alcohol: Strong | Drugs: No""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I had started this movie almost with no expectations since I had seen many political scenes involved in preview. Then the BGM fixed me to the seat. The story was fresh and made us wonder how better can it get,I was not a DQ fan, but this made me a die- hard one. About the acting DQ had done a very role of a playboy-Brat- type and Aparna as a matured-responsible- one. The script is brilliant . This movie showed a satirical part of politics in Kerala. Honestly speaking I had watched around 80 times and still didn't get bored . I'm sure everyone will just love this movie full of life and Zest . They should take more movies like this.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""This film appears on TV all the time. It is apparently very popular among Kerala's youth.

His intention is to teach them the value of money and hard work. They bumble along and some of their antics were quite funny.Dulqer is not much of a comedian but then these are still early days in his budding career. Jacob Gregory's performance must have been made in the editing room. Aparna Gopinath with her pseudo intellectual look was annoying as always.The plot reminded me of some of the 90's films starring Jayram like Witness, Nagarangalil Chennu Raaparkaam and Varnam. All of these films involve two unemployed youths trying hard to get by.Martin Parakkat the director later went on to make the insufferable Charlie.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I thought it would be a good movie but it didn't appeal. Two rich spoilt brat are sent to Kerala to stay with minimum money by which they can sustain and learn something useful.

Korah was funny.\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this movie.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""ABCD is a movie set in a new premise and narrates a fresh story. It starts off well but loses its focus n clarity post the 1st half. ABCD is the story of a a young man Johns living his luxurious youth life in New York. Certain situations in his and his buddy Korah's life lands them up in India and they are forced not to go back. Why and what they do next is the movie..ABCD becomes less engaging and slow post interval. Though the climax comes as a relief for the audience, by then we would have already been wondering why this isn't over yet.ABCD has very few scenes that makes us laugh. But they seem isolated and artificial in the narrative. Johns and Korah's situation in Kerala was not well exploited in the script and that results in the dullness of the movie. The script, the characters should have been much more smarter, crisp and engaging. Then this would have been too good. ABCD falls short of what it could have been.Performance wise Dulquer needs some polishing in the acting department. Jacob Gregory manages off well. Tovino's debut is not bad. Aparna Nair did her part smooth and nice. But apart from all these,, the show stealer was Gopi sunder with the Background Score. Loved the way he used the windows and apple tunes in a fun scene. Though there are certain scenes without any dialogues BG score makes us laugh giving the scenes a comedy touch. Thumbs up for him (y) Go in without any expectations for ABCD.

It's good old fashioned comedy not high drama.The acting was, on the whole, excellent. Yes, there was a little over-acting from some people, but that just added to the fun.Seeing the movie through Western eyes did make me feel there was quite a lot of male chauvinism, particularly how the father treat his wife and the respect he didn't show for his daughter in law, and I was a little taken a back that a suicide bomber could be used in such a humorous way, but on reflection, I figure this was, in some ways a cultural reference that was lost on me.I've given it a 7/10 and I feel it definitely deserves that.

I'm a white British guy who just happens to love Bollywood films.I went with my wife to see this and we both laughed out loud at various bits. I thought the storyline was good; lighthearted and filled with opportunities for a laugh. One of the other reviewers says it was predictable, which I find odd. What exactly are they expecting. It's good old fashioned comedy not high drama.The acting was, on the whole, excellent. Yes, there was a little over-acting from some people, but that just added to the fun.Seeing the movie through Western eyes did make me feel there was quite a lot of male chauvinism, particularly how the father treat his wife and the respect he didn't show for his daughter in law, and I was a little taken a back that a suicide bomber could be used in such a humorous way, but on reflection, I figure this was, in some ways a cultural reference that was lost on me.I've given it a 7/10 and I feel it definitely deserves that. I would definitely go see another Urdu film on the back of this one.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I had a wonderful time watch this one. Had a good laugh and managed to enjoy every scene. The story does leave a lot to be desired and you can sense that it is ultimately inspired from many Bollywood films, but I didn't mind that as long as it managed to entertain, which it did to no ends.The one who completely stole the show and was the funniest was Javed Sheikh. His scenes at home, amidst his family, the little kid, and especially the scenes where the daughter-in-law constantly interrupts him, were just gold. The film was full of wordplay and double-meaned sentences, was hence my type of comedy.So thinking that it is a Pakistani film after all, I wouldn't want to point out too many flaws. I won't only say it exceeded my expectation, but was in fact easily the best comedy to come from Pakistan from the ones that I have watched.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Well I watched it twice just because it was a light and funny movie, no need to pay for movies where you sit and cry, i prefer pay and laugh scenarios. I think director have nailed it what they wanted to produce they have produced, the movie was made to make people laugh and it does just that. There are no serious moment in the movie and Pakistani people have enough seriousness to worry about when they step back in the real world. Sit back and laugh a little and watch this movie without high expectations. You will enjoy it. Some jokes are a little over the top but hey we watch way too bigger crap in Hollywood and Bollywood movies. Supporting Pakistani Cinema all the way.'}]"

BaBo,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""This movie was great! Lots of comedy, lots of emotional scenes, and the girls were cute. The story is also unique, its about sibling love as opposed to all the other romances about relationships and sex. Ha Ji-won was hot, as always. The dude from My Sassy Girl was also great, he played an idiot pretty convincingly, haha. The stories intertwined well together, and the ending didn't really upset either. The only gripe I had in this entire movie is how they dragged on some of the scenes. I know the fool liked to repeat stuff over and over again, but when the people of normal intelligence were doing it too, it seemed fake and over-dramatic. Overall a great film though.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""BA:BO is a 2008 film based closely on a popular webcomic by Kang Full. While the film does contain some comedy, it tells a much deeper story than any of Cha Tae-hyun's other films. I would even say that the film is purely an emotional drama with only mere hints of romance and slight humor. In BA:BO, Ji-ho (Ha Ji-won) returns home after studying and playing the piano in Europe for over ten years. She left Europe because of the frustration that came with an instance of stage fright. Back in her hometown, she meets her mentally challenged, childhood friend, Seung-ryong (Cha Tae-hyun), who runs a small toast shop in order to take care of his younger sister, Ji-in (Park Ha-sun), who unfortunately despises him. Along with Seung-ryong's best friend, Sang-soo (Park Hee- soon), and Hee-yeong (Park Grina), the characters all suffer life problems of their own. It is the village idiot, Seung-ryong, who heals and saves them all.Ji-ho and Sang-soo's interaction with Seung-ryong evokes pity and nostalgic sympathy. Due to a misunderstanding, Sang-soo's guilt as a child drew him close to Seung-ryong as a true friend. Ji-ho on the other hand, was admired by Seung-ryong ever since they were little due to her piano playing that, according to Seung-ryong, would cause snow to fall and stars to appear. It is sweet and a bit sad to see Ha Ji-won's character treat Seung-ryong so nicely because of his innocent mind. While he genuinely likes her, she finds comfort and strength when she looks after him. The film tells a story that really can only be fully understood by reading the expressions and actions of the actors. And it is those actions that can cause the viewer to get a bit teary eyed here and there throughout the film.Speaking of actors, Cha Tae-hyun plays his role as the hardworking, village idiot so convincingly. And he does so with his own style  his signature goofy smile adds so much authenticity to his character's innocence. He really is one of the best actors in Korea. Ha Ji-won impressed me as well, considering that this is one of her first works that I've seen where she isn't type-casted as a cutesy love interest. The slight, emotional changes that her character experiences can be seen thanks to her superb acting, despite the limits that the script has for her character. All the other actors were great as well, besides Park Ha- sun in one scene towards the end of the film  while the scene evokes grievous emotion, it appears questionably forced.It is fascinating how the individual stories of each character seem separate, but all converge in the end. And it is that result that really makes the viewer sit back and think how people, no matter how smart or talented, can affect the lives and happiness of those nearby. BA:BO is a touching film that stays with the viewer well after the ending credits. I highly recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a fan of Korean dramas.""}]"
Andolan,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""After Sanju's imprisonment, several of his films remained incomplete, ANDOLAN(1995) was one of them, The film was almost complete but since Sanju in jail he couldn't finish the dubbing which was dubbed by Chetan Shashital who dubbed for him in several films like Jai Vikraanta, Namak.etc while one song of Sanju was shot on Govinda. The film paired Sanju and Govinda after Taaqatwar and Do Qaidi in the 80s and Jeete Hai Shaan Se. ANDOLAN has an oft.repeated story which is nothing new, the film does have some good dramatic moments, though but nothing out of the ordinary. The film starts with romance,comedy and college scenes like in 90s which hardly appeals, the twist in the story too looks heckeyened Sanju-Govinda clash similar to DEEWAAR does have it's moments yet nothing out of the ordinary. The film has several hard to digest action scenes like in those days, like Sanju coming out of the mud to beat Rami Reddy, also there are several clichs.Direction by Ajiz Sajawal is ordinary Music is decent, Nadeem Shravan give some good melodies Dil To Khoya Hai is a good song,rest are decent tooSanjay Dutt does his role well, however as his voice is dubbed the impact is not as it should be, the dubbing just doesn't sound like his, the film was started in 1992 though in the film there are hardly visible change in hairstyles(something a norm in his those days films) Govinda does his role well, he plays serious roles too well their chemistry is good here, however things changed with their next film Haseena Maan Jayegi which released few years after this film. Somy Ali is a non actress, Mamta Kulkarni is okay Amongst villains Rami Reddy is wooden as always, Mohan Joshi, Dalip Tahil are all as usual Vikram Gokhale is decent, Asha Parekh leaves an impact IShrat Ali is good, rest are okay""}]"

Kidnap,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""First off, let me just say that I can rarely be bothered to write reviews on here. The only reason I decided to was due to: 1) lack of reviews, and most importantly 2) the very few reviews that have been posted here are so incomprehensively negative that the only explanation I can come up with was that they had to be shills (which is surprising to me, as most 'shills' on IMDb are only here to artificially increase a film's positive reviews).That being said, I found these these first two negative reviews utterly baffling. Now I'm no expert film critic, but movies are my number one passion in life. As such, I've seen so many that I've literally arrived to the point where I'm thoroughly jaded...so much so that most everything that I've seen usually leaves me both bored and uninterested, or at best, mildly amused. Now that I've had my mini-rant, I'll continue on with my review.As the title of the film implies, the story is as basic as it gets: a mother's son gets kidnapped, and said mother stops at nothing to get him back. From that simple premise (which has been rehashed millions of times), I began watching this with the expectation that I'll be seeing one clich after another, with gratuitous violence and over-blown CGI and/or cheesy effects mixed in for good measure. I can honestly say that not only were those expectations overturned, but for the first time that I can remember, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat and kept in suspense throughout. That statement may sound generic and trite, but coming from a jaded cinephile, it becomes a huge compliment.I never lost interest for a second, and the sheer intensity and suspense that I felt throughout 'Kidnap' got to the level where I was actively looking to see how many more minutes was left before it ended\x85not because I was bored and wanted to know how much more tedium I had to suffer, but so that I could tell how much more hell the protagonist (and by extension, I) had to go through before all the nail-biting suspense could finally come to an end.It was a taught cat-and-mouse thriller expertly choreographed, and Halle Berry's acting was sublime! In fact, I was initially so put-off by the film's synopsis, I would have passed this over in an instant had it not been for the fact that Ms Berry was in it! The acting, cinematography and stunt-work were masterfully crafted in such a way so as to get you emotionally invested throughout. I think that is why this film engendered such a visceral reaction whilst watching it. If you cannot relate to nor care about the characters, the film you're watching falls flat, and you consequently lose interest very quickly. Not so with 'Kidnap'. The relatability of Berry's character, plus the superb job she did with this role, puts you right in the car seat next to her.If you are like me, and suffer from the ennui that inevitably comes from having seen almost every movie ever made, and are looking for the proverbial 'white knuckle ride' and adrenaline rush, then I cannot recommend 'Kidnap' strongly enough. In fact, I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that this is on my top 4 list of films I've seen this year thus far!So in a way, I give thanks to the two negative reviewers. Had it not been for them, I wouldn't have even bothered writing this review!""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I love action movies without aliens and superheroes so I was exited to see this movie where Halle Berry goes all out in her attempts to safe her kid. The base of the story isn't that bad but oh how I hate it when writers can't come up with logical behavior even in high pressure situations.With a little bit more creativity this actually could have been a very decent movie, but they took the easy way and at times it just was annoying how the story developed.So a big disappointment.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Not really even sure where to start. We'll go through the low points blow by blow.Storyline - there isn't one. The entire plot makes no sense, and is so ridiculous as to have you laughing out loud for most of the movie. Yeah kid gets kidnapped and mother will stop at nothing to get him back. Seen that before. But what you've not seen is the utter drivel they come up with in this movie. Utter garbage dressed up as some kind of action. It's the worst story I've seen in as long as I can remember. I haven't even got to the end yet, and I'm writing this.Acting - woeful beyond belief. Halle Berry would have to have been utterly desperate to get involved with this garbage. Minutes of talking to herself about how she won't let her kid go, all while in the middle of a car chase. Obviously the part is written and there's not much she can do about the story line, but unless she needs the money, she'd just walk away. No idea why she's even involved.Action - appalling. 'High-speed' stunts filmed at about 5km/h, then sped up to seem faster. Non-sensical action scenes that add nothing other than further ridicule to this movie.Cinematography - I can't say I've ever seen anything as laughably appalling as this. During the 'high-speed' chases, we get minutes worth of tyre-going-around footage, interspersed with minutes of yellow lines on the road. We get it - they're driving.Overall this movie is atrocious and simply not worth your time. Unless you want to spend a couple hours yelling at the TV to get her to actually do something towards getting her son back. Abysmal, appalling, ghastly garbage.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'I saw this because I like Halley Berry movies and figured that this would be another good movie. I was horribly wrong.The plot has too many holes and makes no sense whatsoever.After many miles of ""chasing"" the kidnappers she finally thinks to ram into them once her van is almost out of gas? Did she think to do this when they were stuck in traffic or while surrounded by cars on the highway? Or maybe when there was a cop following her?Nope, she waits until they are on a deserted road.When the kidnapper comes after her with a shotgun, where does the genius hide? In her mini van with wrap around windows. Good thing the bad guy decides not to shoot out the glass and shoot her.Finally we get near the end of this horrible movie and the woman kidnapper sicks a dog on the Halley Berry and her kid. Somehow after killing the kidnapper the dog mysteriously disappears and never shows up again.Possibly the dog was as board with this movie as the audience and simply gave up to do something better.These are not the only horrible parts of the movie, but the most glaring.It\'s an hour and half of my life that I wish that I could get back. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews, this is a horrible movie and should be skipped.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'I normally wouldn\'t write a spoiler for a review, but I find it necessary to pick this movie apart piece by piece \'cos the story was a load of Bull. First of all, I\'m not sure which pisses me off more, the script writer that left so many holes in the story or the main character which Halle Berry played quite well. Suffice to say, while I find Halle\'s acting to be believable, I find the personality of the character she played quite confusing and unappealing. I really couldn\'t help disliking her and her choices from the beginning of the movie till the very end. I thought, ""well, how stupid can she get"" every five minutes. And here is why.1. Why didn\'t she slam into the kidnappers\' car when she had the chance at the stop light? I would think adrenaline was pumping at that moment the incidence just occurred and some more desperate howbeit reckless attempt would have been made to recover the boy.2. It took her so long to get on the phone and call the cops while chasing the car that had her son. Really?! And don\'t tell us she lost her phone. All you need to do to attract the police in all 50 states is to rear end or side swipe a few cars and keep going. They will do the calling for you. She didn\'t as much as bash any other vehicle during the first half of the ""desperate"" chase.3. She was driving like my granny. 4. The scene where a cop on a motorcycle attempted to pull her over was just so silly. All she had to was keep going when the cop asked her to pull over till he called it in and had other cops on the chase. well, another scene that made this character seem like an idiot.5. So she offered up her financial instruments and didn\'t think to keep the pin as bargaining chip till she was at the point of ensuring an exchange then went ahead to let the kidnapper into her car... Not beside her, behind her. Then drove to a secluded highway. Why on earth would the kidnapper that has your son, your cards, your pin, keep you alive when the only thing keeping you from reporting the cards stolen is being alive? Is this character just daft or these is how people actually react when they are in crisis?6. She overpowers and throws out a woman twice her size, positioned behind her while she is driving and being strangled at the same time out of a moving mini-van. All the while with door closed. The only script allowed to have that sort of impractical scenario is a James Bond movie. Absolutely unbelievable. The woman also came into her vehicle with no phones on her with which to alert her ""boyfriend"" when she was tossed from the car?7. She actually stopped a stranger from getting run over by putting her vehicle between said stranger and a car about to run him over at a time she had the option of intercepting the kidnapper about to get away with her son. I believe natural instinct is self preservation before all else except a person has specific training to react otherwise in those circumstances. When i saw this scene, it didn\'t make her out to be a hero to me, I just felt she must not be trying to save her son.8. It took her almost an hour into the movie after driving Miss Daisy behind the kidnappers for her to realize she could rear end the car... guess what? Right about the time the car was running empty on gas. *roll my eyes*9. The kidnappers were painted not as newbies, but repeat offenders who did this for a living. Well, it didn\'t look like it. If they were pros, they had every opportunity to take the boy across state lines while the mum was taking a ""cruise"" around town.10. Then there is the question of how the boy made it from the car with the male kidnapper to the house where the kids were being kept. One moment, the boy is in the car with the male kidnapper being chased by the mum in distress, the next moment, the mum is asking ""where is my son?"" and she\'s fishing for an ID on the kidnapper\'s lifeless body. #Sheish!11. Kidnappers\' Den. She sees a sawn off shotgun lying on a table and she leaves it. Really?! She\'s anti-gun? 12. The boat ploy was also dumb. If she could fool the woman, she couldn\'t fool a dog for a second. The dog would have gone for the water immediately and started barking not after she had fired off a few rounds into an empty boat which un-propelled was able to move away from a powerful flashlight that fast? Errmmm! Really?So I guess the only thing you could consider smart about the main character was the fact that she was able to pick up on the ""neighbour\'s"" lie? Psssssh! The main character was not properly developed and profiled. First acting conservative and unsure of what to do then later switching to aggressive, alpha personality. Every other thing that occurred in this plot was pure luck and stupidity on the kidnappers part. Well, I didn\'t see any well calculated attempt at recovering the child. The script is weak and empty. So thumbs down. I lost empathy for her and felt like smacking a head all though the movie maybe to knock a little sense into her. She should be loosing custody after this episode.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Warning Spoilers!This main character is so damn stupid. Beyond any reasonable logic. When she had a chance to kill the man who took her son, she didn't. When it's time for some cool stunt driving scenes, the highway is full of cars.

Who the hell drives with their arms fully extended and elbows locked? Then her conversations with herself are just ludicrous. She's constantly changing her clothes while driving. Gives her wallet, with her address, credit cards, and cash to the kidnappers, so I guess she won't need gas money and wants them to know where she lives.

People without common sense would enjoy this.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Kidnap tells the story of Karla Dyson, who on a summer day the local park together with her son Frankie to blow of some steam and strengthen their mother-son bond. However disaster strikes when Frankie is kidnapped from under everyone\'s noses. Before all hope is lost Karla is able to catch a glimpse of a man and a women forcing Frankie into their car. The kidnappers quickly make their escape, however what they don\'t know is that they have chosen the wrong person to mess with as Karla wills top at nothing to recover her lost son.If this small synopsis got you excited please curb your enthusiasm as this pretty much describes the entire movie. Right from the start it is clear that the movie itself is as generic as the title would suggest. The first act is a very obvious attempt at establishing the mother- son bond such that we as an audience actually care about what happens to Frankie. This is executed so poorly however that it almost reaches an adverse effect and kind of makes you wish Frankie gets kidnapped. When this finally does happen the movie turns into a weird action movie that goes on for what feels like an eternity. When the movie finally reaches its conclusion it does so in an incredibly predicting manner and throughout the film there are no interesting twists to the story.Most of the action in the movie comes from a very long chase scene in the middle of the film. This sequence is however not very riveting since it is very obvious Karla will eventually catch up with the kidnappers because otherwise the movie would just end then and there. During these scenes the writers felt it necessary for Karla to spell out what is happening, often she would scream ""They\'ve got my baby"" or ""My son is in that car"". It\'s about as stupid as it sounds and these are just a few examples. As much as Karla cares about her son as little does she seem to care about others, while chasing her kidnappers she causes many traffic accidents for instance when she is backing up on a highway where people are driving at 100 km/h. She must have caused the death or at the very least severe injury of many innocent people, however everyone seems to forget this when everyone calls her a \'true American hero\' after she, spoiler warning, saves her son from the kidnappers.Kidnap is directed by Luis Prieto who makes a lot of weird creative decisions throughout. The chase sequences for instance are intercut with several aerial views of the two cars driving along the highway. These shots often go on for what feels like several minutes in what appears to be an attempt to pad the movies runtime. This was obviously necessary since the movie just barely exceeds Hollywood\'s\' self- imposed 90 minute minimum, however it still manages to outstay it\'s welcome and bores halfway through. Furthermore Prieto never tries to make the movie visually interesting and hardly puts any focus on the emotional side of things as the only emotion Karla shows is anger, she never seems desperate or afraid.Halle Berry, the actress portraying Karla also hardly appear to put in any effort. Kidnap by far marks her worst performance of those I\'ve seen and if this is representative of her future work then I really hope her role in the new Kingsman movie is limited to only a few scenes. However considering her multiple Golden Globes nominations and even an Academy Award win I really think that his terrible performance has more to do with the source material not giving her anything to really work with. Halle Berry for me is an actress that is best suited in the supporting category while in Kidnap she is on her own monologuing most of the time.Kidnap is by far the worst movie of the year up until now. The acting is terrible, the story is bland and predictable and nothing interesting is happening on the screen. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, however if you really want to know the story of Karla and Frankie then watch the trailer instead and save yourself 90 costly minutes of your life.My rating: 1/10'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'First of all, I saw Kidnap at a sneakpreview in The Netherlands.

Just like the clowns, aka film critics.It was another kidnap film that Halle Barry in it, that's similar to her previous film 'The Call'. It did not take long to get into the action. A hardworking mother, going through divorce, fighting for her son's custody. While engaging in a phone call, she loses her son in an amusement park. The alert mother quickly jumps into pursuing when he was seen forcefully taken in a stranger's car. The remaining events take place on the road, with car chases, with a twist before the conclusion.Nicely written screenplay and well performed actors, particularly Halle Berry. I have never seen she had played such an energetic role in the recent time. Whatever the storyline is, it's kind of an inspiring film. How a mother fought for her son. Totally a mother instinct. You can't simply expect like the film 'Taken'. It might not be realistic, but cinematically honest. The same thing happens in the animal world too. Sad that the film released after so many delays. Moreover, how people responded to it. Believe me, it is a nice film and I definitely suggest it to all.8/10""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'I watch a lot of movies.

Drive,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""One reviewer here suggested that instead of seeing Drive you should see what Drive was aspiring to be Layer Cake. Drive is nothing like Layer Cake nor even tries to be. They have nothing in common, and the comment is just absurd. It is a far far better film though. From it's title sequence written in cursive pink (which a ton of idiots just did not get for some reason) to it's retro soundtrack. It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's, 70's and 80's. If you have not seen films from this era (i do believe so many reviewers here have not) you will not entirely get this film.This is a man with no name film. Instead of horses and cowboys we get fast muscle cars and ruthless gangsters. Our hero is a man with no name. He is also a man of very few words that can break out into fits of extreme violence at any moment to protect those he cares about. We get no back story to our hero just like the Eastwood pictures, which makes the film even more effective. He is not your typical Vin Diesel blabbering idiot action hero. He is an old fashioned action hero. Too many here did not understand this, and decided this was bad acting/directing. It is far better to imagine what Gosslings character has done to arrive at this point, than to be shown in some cheesy flash back sequence. Albert Brooks (who is just fantastic as usual), Ron Pearlman, and Bryan Cranston all provide nice contrast to our quiet hero.Another reviewer here stated there was no explanation for the second car at the pawn shop. Well there was. I will not give it away here, but you will find the answer in the motel sequence. The violence has also been hated on here, but it is just part of the world he lives in. The fact that he can be just as cruel as the gangsters adds to the mystery of his character.Not one negative review is credible. Unless you were raised on Transformer and Fast and Furious pictures. Then I guess you would need more CG, louder music, and bad duologue so you could understand the film easier. Or maybe you just need more imaginary computerized cars doing spectacular things on screen to hold your attention. The fact is this is a fantastic film, filled with great performances, and some of the best chase sequences since bullet. Be smart see films that matter.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""'Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it\'s there to stay.This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you\'ve never seen him, speaking only when necessary, with tension and fury in his eyes. He\'s silent, caring, and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film, for it is truly that different. ""Drive"" is already the best of the year, because I\'m POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has. This is not just a classic for its genre, but a beautiful and bold classic in general.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I\'ve seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both ""difficult"" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn\'s situation is that he makes films about ""Primal"" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla\'s intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a ""Vlad the Viking goes to the New World"" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly ""directed"" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn\'t have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film\'s true ""feel"".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling\'s half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichs provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling\'s portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling\'s quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling\'s film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro\'s Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann\'s hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA clich of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality  humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality  is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after \'The Notebook\' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It\'s not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i\'m not really keen on the subject, or it\'s actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it\'s about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i\'ve seen in quiet some time. It\'s not your basic shoot em\' picture. It has this slight \'noire\' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters, let\'s talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn\'t call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That\'s the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on, Gosling\'s character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It\'s not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren\'t expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it\'s level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it\'s overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it\'s a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT\'S how awesome this was. It\'s an art-house action flick at it\'s finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Wow!! Did I miss something here? The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot: it's barely believable and lacking in substance. While the soundtrack is very good, it also cannot save the weak dialogue which is mostly Ryan Gosling staring at people and things and not saying much at all -- we're supposed to think that's really cool. He also likes to wear that scorpion jacket even when it's been bloodied. Becoming best buddies with the neighbor's kid on the first try - really? And then willing to risk his life even after the neighbor's boyfriend comes back from prison even though she previously hit on him - really? Also, outsmarting a police helicopter in LA in the first chase scene - really?The whole movie has that whole trying really hard to be cool vibe but it's really not.

I never wrote a review before though...""Drive"" is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the ""I want my money back!"" or ""I want my two hours back!"" way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than ""Leon"", for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than ""Drive"" but have lower ratings. In my opinion it\'s a 6/10 movie. Full of clichs, weak plot, no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK, but that doesn\'t add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well, what acting? There are no characters, not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest, with a toothpick in his mouth like he\'s Stallone in ""Cobra"". A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey, he is a mechanic, part time stunt driver, part time get-away driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what\'s with all that violence? Broken skulls, throats cut, blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don\'t fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 year-old who managed to get tickets. And don\'t get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway, there are so many things that I didn\'t like in this movie that they wouldn\'t fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean, 8.7? Lets have some sense. That\'s how ""Matrix"", ""The usual suspects"" or ""Forrest Gump"" are rated... ""Drive"" is just a ""B"" movie and doesn\'t deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless, the world turns upside down.EDIT: OK, I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It\'s just a highly overrated movie.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being, and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Welcome to the first edition of Movie Math. Beware, I spoil the entire movie in this review. My sincerest apologies. First, I do not like to applaud mediocrity, even if it is well done mediocrity. I understand the underlying point of the movie, but it was really buried and I shouldn\'t be able to get to that point so quickly. The audience prefers to be led, not slapped into submission. It just stings less after you realize you paid $12 to be treated like an idiot. Second, I did love the neon pink script, the members only jacket and the 80\'s pop (which, alone, is awesome but seemed like a loud, annoying filler for scenes that had absolutely nothing going on). Combined, they seemed like an afterthought.The movie consists of about 30 minutes of good solid plot line stuffed with about 1.5 hours worth of pointless fluff (ex. the river scene, all the staring, the shots of watching TV, the random garage & test driving scenes) all meant to build character and inspire (or something). This failed completely because I actually connected more with Albert Brooks\' & Bryan Cranston\'s characters. Both of whom had less airtime than the main characters.And plot line- wait, there isn\'t A plot line, there are several, terribly integrated plot lines. Think: The Notebook + Grindhouse + Steve Mcqueen + Tarantino. The narration was so clich it made me wince. Never, EVER, should narration take the place of integral character development.The love plot is absurd. She doesn\'t know Gosling, he\'s super creepy, says nothing and somehow she gets a warm/cozy vibe so she invites him over to hang out with her kid. And I thought the romance in Twilight was bad (-1 star simply because I was forced to write Twilight). The violence was eh. I\'ve seen gory horror flicks integrate gratuitous violence into the story line better, and in a less in-your-face manner, so that was unimpressive and unimaginative(-1). Especially because, unless you\'re sadistic, no one actually enjoys watching someone get stabbed in the eye. As for the dialog, there isn\'t any, and the cars have fewer appearances than sentences. So this leads me to believe the title is meant to have more than one connotation. Warning: here is where I get all ""artsy"". The title, Drive, can be interpreted in two different ways: one being the more literal sense: someone that drives a car; the second alluding perseverance. If it is the second, then the Refn/Amini duo are sorely lacking all around and Mulligan desperately wants her kid to die quietly at the hands of an insane mechanic. There\'s some perseverance for you.That being said, I did not enjoy this movie. I do not require the Michael Bay effect to be entertained but please, do not treat me like a Teen wolf/Twilight moviegoer (-1 AGAIN). Long pauses do not develop character, especially when a blank affect is meant to be a representation of stoicism/wide-eyes and a mom-haircut represent vulnerability(-1 for being a giant stereotype). Even if those blank stares are backed up by a wicked soundtrack (hell yes, Chris Martinez, high five! +1)and excellent cinematography (it\'s already been done before but whatever: +1). However, I was constantly reminded of other movies while watching(Collateral, anyone? -1) and I was left feeling like someone (Gosling and Refn/Aminihad) watched far too many Steve Mcqueen movies. And then they attempted, quite literally, to copy the dynamics. Unfortunately, the entire team (and some of the audience)failed to realize that Mr. Mcqueen\'s movies were written FOR him and Mr. Gosling has not quite reached that level. So -1 for not being original. I was not impressed by Mr. Gosling\'s acting (What acting? It\'s so easy to stand around and chew a toothpick: -1) and I honestly do not understand all the hype regarding Ms. Mulligan. I\'ve seen almost all her movies and she plays the doe-eyed victim with a giant heart in every. single. one.So -1 for typecasting. This also includes Christina Hendricks, by the way. She looked SO uncomfortable. Well, maybe that was the point, or maybe it was because her pants were too tight and she was robbing a pawn shop wearing 5"" heels. I should -1 for it being unrealistic, but this movie would then have a negative rating.Gosling and Mulligan attempt the profound ""say something by not saying anything at all"" (-1 for bad directing) but Mulligan appears dimwitted and Gosling goes from mimicking George Washington on the side of Mt. Rushmore to suddenly being a skilled fighter. I did not see that coming. Maybe that was yet another point?The stunt driver should be commended, though, he/she had some pretty tricks done with effortless flair (+ 1 for talent). So I tip my hat to you, sir/ma\'am. Mustangs are not easy to do donuts in.I was bored an hour into the movie (-.5) and was squirming at the pretentiousness of the director by the second hour (-.5). That by itself says quite a bit seeing as I am an avid moviegoer and watch just about anything. May I reiterate that being reminded of others\' work does not dredge feelings of nostalgia, it makes me want my $12 back.

After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to protecting what is important to you.

Compelling tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional world of the protagonists. Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world. View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography. Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun intended). I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging.

First of all there\'s no real story. I feel no connection to any of the characters or the acting. Gosling is this weird arrogant silent guy that we never learn much about. All the other characters are quite clich. The coincidence is also pretty strange that Gosling happened to live in the same floor as the guy he wants to help with money problems is actually in dirty business with the guy sponsoring Gosling. Plus the movie is called ""drive."" I expected to see little more stunts than just unrealistic and unnecessary handbrake spinning in only one scene. The filming and setting were the only good things about this movie. Not even the music was catchy. I feel like I\'ve been have a strange plot less and lifeless dream while watching this movie. NO substance at all and strange acting i will rate this movie maximum a 6.8. I don\'t understand what the hype is and why people are going crazy about it. It really is something just to pass time let alone a masterpiece. As if everything mentioned wasn\'t bad enough the violence is just downright ridiculous and again unnecessary.

I don\'t even know what else to say, this is a movie i will remember for being slow and strange.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Seemingly a loner, the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract, the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a well-worn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller, yet the massively talented director, who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive, crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn, previously known for the fantastic Bronson, and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy, is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick, but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson, the influence was a little more obvious, with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however, the traces are a little more subtle, visible in the impeccable technical touches, and the use of dissolves, pensive long takes, and slow zooms, a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film, filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast, and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, the ever dependable Ron Perlman, and particularly Brooks, who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance, which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season. Mulligan shows characteristic heart in a largely overlooked role, yet the film unquestionably belongs to Gosling. Often heralded as one of the finest actors of his generation, in Drive Gosling delivers his best work yet as the driver; a quiet role that is all the more effective due to the subtlety of the performance. He displays an ability to ratchet up the tension using just the slightest widening of his eyes and tensing of his jawline, and when the character is pushed to act more forcefully, Gosling transitions from almost silent observer to brutal aggressor so swiftly that it leaves one breathless. It's work that he makes look easy, yet it's the most focused performance seen in an action film in quite some time.There's something undeniably retro about Drive, with its neon opening titles and 80s infused soundtrack, but the film seems remarkably fresh. Smart action filmmaking is so hard to come by these days, so Drive delivers refreshing variety, beginning the time of year when the so-called prestige pictures are released with a bang.tinribs27.wordpress.com""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as an escape car artist for local thugs. He gets involved in the life of his next door neighbor, her kid and the husband who owes money to the mafia boss Gosling's character happens to works for.The film plays out terribly as the murky and meager plot is all over the place and the pacing of the film so off, it just beggars belief. The many scenes just showing Gosling's blood stained clothes are so slow and stretched that you can see the changing of seasons in the background. And every time our hero starts to talk there's a standard 6 seconds delay before he actually starts to mutter his script lines. Pause in a conversation can add drama to the moment, but I shouldn't have to be tearing the hair from my cranium while watching it. Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers; excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked, then strip away the interesting characters, the music, the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.I'm seriously left dumbfounded as to what prompts people to vote on this miserable excuse for entertainment with more than 6 stars. Perhaps it is the overall quality of films nowadays which seems to be in a hasty decline, rendering people clueless as to what rating to give to a film. But I can safely say that this project is as lifeless as it is artless and I would recommend the 1999 movie Ghost Dog in stead. A movie that shares many parallels with 'Drive' but which is made with far more authenticity, humor and overall class. Not to mention it having an actual silver lining and point to it.30/100""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'This is an awful movie. Perhaps all the more so because there were the ever-so-slight hints that it might have been good.Watch the first half-hour. Gosling\'s (unnamed) character, when spoken to, takes ridiculously long pauses--upwards of 10 seconds--to respond.>>>Spoilers ahead The story is, um, flimsy. Porn-movie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well (sure, it looked really cool when that other car showed up, but... wwwhy was it there, exactly?), and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it: Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that\'s really been masterminded by... the guy who\'s bankrolling his race car? Huh? (and, no, the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this).As much as I love Ryan Gosling, he\'s just plain bad here. Maybe not ""just plain"" bad; spectacularly, pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas"" that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can\'t tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he\'s as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn\'t work.Carey Mulligan is okay, but her character is pretty one-dimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I\'m sorry, I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan\'s husband appears, there\'s actually a little tension for a bit, and I began to hope for some substance (especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does). Sadly, ""Standard"" is killed off fairly quickly.There\'s no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they\'re mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what\'s there is clichd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling\'s partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character\'s interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I\'ve loved since ""Lost in America"". It breaks my heart, because he\'s actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando, I kid you not. Thoughtful, emotional, utterly believable, but since he\'s the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for, he\'s not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action, at least. And there really isn\'t much. For a movie about a driver, there honestly isn\'t that much driving. The movie opens with a not-bad robbery getaway, but there\'s only one more serious chase later on, and even IT isn\'t especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH ""Bullitt""? And, speaking of car action, there\'s one scene where Gosling\'s character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet, afterwards, we see the front end of his car, seemingly undamaged. Are mid-70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in ""Drive"". There are some genuinely original scenes of violence (and, to be fair, well-executed). Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared, well, this might have been a different movie.This is one of those ""emperor\'s-new-clothes"" things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while.

Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.Every plot element of Drive was so unrealistic that I found it impossible to suspend belief. The characters are equally unbelievable. Less than an hour into the picture I knew how it would end. The only question was whether Gosling's character would survive, but by that point I didn't care. All the characters were too stupid to live. Violence has its place in film, but it is not a substitute for characters, a plot, and a story even when the stupid are getting their just deserts.Nothing in this picture hasn't been well done in other movies.

I am convinced critics will only give a positive review if a movie is depressing and nihilistic. Don\'t believe the hype that this is some cinematic artistic achievement, when over 30 minutes of a two hour run time is filled with dead silence or overly long awkward pauses in dialogue , it\'s not ""hip and artistic"" it\'s just boring, nor is it ""stylish and clever"" when our main protagonist , who clearly has the upper hand at the end, defies common sense by putting himself needlessly in danger and not taking necessary precautions. I also don\'t find the retro 80s styling and soundtrack of a movie set in modern times to be ""artistic brilliance"" either, it\'s just distracting and awkward. Even our heroes\' intentions seem to defy common sense,...risk your life for a girl you didn\'t even screw,a kid that\'s not yours, and her ex-con husband who doesn\'t even like you, that\'s not heroic, that\'s idiotic. If you want to be duped by critics who would have you believe this is ""stylish and clever neo noir"" go ahead and waste your time and money, but trust me ,once you dissect this movie for what it really is, it becomes a pointless exercise in nihilism whose plot points defy logic, common sense, and motivation, all glossed over by an over-stylized retro-80s feel and boring silence and self contemplation. Were there some good action sequences?, yes, but if you add them all up they take up about ten minutes of the run time.

Here is a character who is equally quiet but nice guy who obviously has a lot of history but nothing is mentioned or anything acknowledged up front.The tone is fantastic and I love that the director avoided the classic clichs that are so rampant in movies like this by giving us what is essentially a ""B"" movie and fills it with great actors and allows them to do what they do best. WOW!Albert Brooks is the Oscar snub of the year by far and I don\'t know how. Here is a guy who is always good at what he does and is a brilliant comedian but here he is a former small time movie producer who has deep roots in the criminal underworld and is so convincing that you have a hard time believing that this is the same guy from Lost in America or Nemo\'s dad. Nuance is the best tool in the performance and I can tell you that this is an understated performance that is so layered you just can\'t help but feel for the guy even though he is a brutal killer. He wants to be a nice guy but his actions and his business don\'t allow him to be.No movie was as cool and more riveting from start to finish than this one.

May come off a little slow, but it catches you off guard, and that's what makes film great.Poetic yet violent, malnourished yet gruesome.

A protagonist which everyone can relate to, a man driven by nothing, a loner on a road with nothing and no one on it, though when something special comes along, his whole world changes.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Last year one of the big films that I think was a surprise hit was called Drive. I was always curious to see this movie, but unfortunately missed it. From what I had heard it was a must see so I rented it and absolutely fell in love with it. Reminding me a bit of the old action movies from the 70's and 80's with those great old cars that could take one heck of a beating with the anti-hero who wins your heart over and then we get a million sequels trying to out bank the previous film. Anyways, Drive offers something different, a new cult classic for a generation that is a bit ADD, this gives you something exciting or great to watch each second. I can't tell you what an amazing opening chase scene they choreographed, not to mention some very exciting action scenes. Ryan Gosling continues to be a star on the high rise proving his leading man qualities and to be an action star, he just steals the show as Driver.Driver lives in a low-rent apartment building and works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. The Driver works anonymously, never for the same people twice, and allows them only five minutes to do their business. He meets his neighbor Irene in the apartment building elevator and later helps her and her young son when Irene has car trouble at a local market. Shannon owns the garage the Driver works at and arranges his other jobs. Shannon persuades the mobster Bernie Rose to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race after seeing the Driver's skill. Bernie's business partner is Nino, a Jewish mobster. But when Driver has been set up he realizes that not only does he have to protect himself but those he cares about most.The car chase scenes are so well put together, I haven't been this excited since Death Proof. I also loved how Driver's face in the first scene just stayed emotionless, he knows he's good and that no matter what how to out run the cops. He's a man with a mission who doesn't have anyone in his life, but when a woman and her son come into his, he will fight for them because they're worth it. He has a man, who's his boss, who is almost like his father figure and their relationship is not only believable but relatable for anyone. Bryan Cranston has come quite a way since Malcolm in the Middle, he does a great job and conveys such a likability to what could have been a bland and boring character. The bloodshed in the movie is absolutely insane, like I said, this reminds you a bit of a 70's action drive in movie. There's buckets of blood and tons of violence. I also loved having Ron Pearlman as this typical mobster who's terrifying to cross paths with but you can't forget that he's Jewish. What a great addition to the character. I think Drive was one of the better movies that came out of 2011, it has everything that you could want in an action movie. Action, romance, great soundtrack, cool cars and awesome chase scenes. Let's put it this way, I rented it, watched it, the next day I bought it, it was totally worth it.9/10""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Seriously people, don't believe the ridiculous hype about this movie, it is without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. My wife and I are huge movie fans and watch on average 5 new films a week, 10 minutes into this film we are both looking at each other with a 'is this movie for real' look on our faces, and by the end we realised we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives we would never get back again.Rylan Gosling is a total joke from start to finish, his total lack of any script is just the start, in fact by the end of the film (and yes we did make it to the end, somehow) I was glad he still wasn't saying much, and the little that did come from it was just clichd nonsense. This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all, especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with, wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back, and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot, what there was of it, is so old and tired and so overdone, the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them, probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan, who is a real favourite of ours, was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character - the single mum at home. And the clichs just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme, graphic and vicious, which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it, unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly again, now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate - characters that aren't black and white, minimal dialogue to add to the tension, and stunning camera-work to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead, Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.""}]"

I love them so much it is my favorite film series. I love First Blood to death this is my personal favorite action film. It is in my top 5 Stallone\'s favorite action films part 4 and 5 is Cliffhanger and Demolition Man. It is my personal favorite action film in the Rambo series. I love Rambo: First Blood Part II to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in the action genre. First Blood is my personal favorite action film of all time it is right up there with Part II. It is my number 3 favorite action in the Rambo series but I still love First Blood to death.This is my comic book hero this is my childhood movie the movie I grew up with it. This is the best movie ever my all time favorite action movie. It is the best of the best of all time. Sylvester Stallone co-write the script and started and the men can act, he is an action hero on screen in my opinion his best film. Yours is Rocky mine is Rambo action hero. I love Rambo\'s Survival Knife he rally\'s on his knife. ""I could have killed \'em all, I could\'ve killed you. In town you\'re the law, out here it\'s me. Don\'t push it! Don\'t push it or I\'ll give you a war you won\'t believe. Let it go. Let it go! ""First Blood is a realistic film portrayed about John Rambo a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran who saw hell in the Vietnam War and he is hunted by the past. Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character\'s eyes.. ""First Blood"" doesn\'t deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects. It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real. He feels that society is against him and he is angry. The movie has ton\'s of action, the motorcycle chases. Rambo climbs the wall of mountain and is been pursued by a helicopter and the police officer becomes the killer and try\'s to shoot Rambo with a riffle. Rambo jumps and hangs him self on the tree. That jump was for real and Sylvester Stallone really performed it. Rambo uses his martial arts to defend him self against abusive corrupt cops to escape. I love how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations. The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill, yet, he doesn\'t kill a single human in the film on purpose. John Rambo uses M60 machine gun and shoot up various stores in town including police station destroys the gun store and gas station. \n \nBrian Dennehy and Richard Crenna both acted opposite Sylvester Stallone and they both acted well. Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle was excellent bad guy he performs his character well. Richard Crenna is Colonel Sam Trautman who trained and command Rambo in Vietnam for 3 years he is excellent as father figure to Rambo.

A dark yet sensitive film that follows one of the great action stars as he fights to survive, a mesmerising action masterpiece.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'First Blood is simply one of the best films ever made. I think it transcends the action film genre and has stood the test of time. Stallone was immensely popular back in the 80\'s and if it is true that he hated the first cut of the film, then one can only say that he is lucky that he didn\'t get his wish to scrap the entire thing.John Rambo is first introduced to us as he is walking into a small town to look for a friend of his that he served in Vietnam with. Upon discovering that he contracted cancer coming back from the war, Rambo wanders aimlessly into town. He is greeted by a small town overzealous sheriff named Will Teasle, played wonderfully by Brian Denehy. He at first tells Rambo that he will help him out and give him a ride. When Rambo asks if he can find a good place to eat, Teasle directs him to a diner about 10 miles up the highway. Rambo asks if there is a law against him eating in the town, Teasle, says yea, me. This sets up the premise as Rambo begins walking back into town. Arrested for vagrancy, Rambo is taken to the local jail and we meet some of the local redneck officers, notably, a young David Caruso, who seems to be the only one who empathizes with Rambo. Finally, he escapes the jail and takes the entire small town sheriff department and the military on a hunt into the local ""jungle."" First Blood has strength of character. It has frenetic action scenes and every actor in the film is at the top of their game. Samuel Trautman, Rambo\'s mentor and former Colonel in the war, is played by Richard Crenna as a no nonsense but empathetic man. He knows Rambo has pushed back a little too hard but he understands where his plight comes from. He wants to avoid more bloodshed but at the same time he doesn\'t completely agree with how Rambo has been treated. He is obviously a law abiding citizen, but he knows that not all the laws were upheld when dealing with Rambo.Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell\'s vision is still present, this is more of Stallone\'s creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.First Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.10/10'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric.

For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it\'s his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the \'misunderstood\' Vietnam vet.   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 & 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you\'d probably be better off watching the news.  ""First Blood"" is actually more akin to those \'survival in the wilderness\' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.   That\'s not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it\'s never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo\'s supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more ""Cop Land"" than ""Cobra""\n   Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.

Stallone always suffers from the perception engendered by his appearance.  he is a somewhat short fellow with a body of bulging unpronoucable muscles, and a sad bassett-hound face that looks like it was designed by someone out of ""Oliver Twist.""but the man can flat-out act.  he gives John Rambo depth and reality.  he comes across as far too fit and far too silent because Rambo is far too fit and far too silent.  like his character in ""Copland,"" Stallone is playing a guy who pretty much wants to be left alone and is caught up by a bunch of people around him who are overly enthused by their own status.\nwhile i can understand the dismissal of this film as just a patriotic action sop, i cannot also accept that Stallone does not give a good performance. the man has been characatured; he\'s an easy target.  he\'s a really built short-guy.  but Stallone\'s intelligence and creativity drove his first film, ""Rocky,"" and neither quality has deserted him since.  like Michael Caine, he does seem to take any old lame role offered to him.  but he always gets paid, and he always puts everything into his performances.\ni\'ll never campaign for this film to be considered a ""great"" film, but i think i\'ll always defend it\'s star as a guy who works too hard too often to get the such little credit.i guess the best way i can put it is, i watched ""First Blood,"" and i believed him.  i believed Stallone.last time i checked, that is what an actor is supposed to do.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels.

Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to.  War.

He spoke to me of feeling proud, in his uniform, having completed his tour, of stepping off the plane.And then he told me of the ridicule and scorn he received from the general public upon his return. A return where he was called a baby killer, despite never having actually killed anyone himself surprisingly, where it was simply assumed he was the one at fault, that the public would scorn him, forget he was human, treat him like a social outcast. Treat him, like an animal.Which is part of the reason he and I bonded so well over this movie when we first watched it. Sure, it's an agrandised tale of a badly treated Vet, a man forgotten by his government, much like my own father.When we see Stallone performing as Rambo in this movie, he's not fantastical, he's not superman, he's a man who's been wronged, who fights back the only way he knows how.When you see this movie, understand that this is, despite the fantastical elements in this film, a very accurate portrayal of how our veterans are treated. They're forgotten, they're given over to an ill equipped health system, be they in Australia or America, they're treated like outcasts.The beautiful thing about First Blood, when you watch it, is it's so easy to identify with Rambo, so easy to see he's just a good man, having a bad time, who reacts in possibly the worst way to whats happening to him... but that worst way, is the only appropriate way. The torture he endures under a biased prejudiced sheriff, the lack of respect for serving his country, the health system that should've picked up on his quite obvious PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), none of it was there for him.When it hits the fan, and Rambo goes on his escape, ask yourself, is he really hunting them? If they had've let him go, wouldn't it have been better for them? Didn't he just want to be left alone after all? The one message this movie, less than subtly puts across, is something we all need to learn. Whether its WW1 or 2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm 1 or 2, you're not expected to agree with the war, you're not expected to support the war. But for gods sake support your troops. Next time your national day rolls around, like in Australia for Anzac Day, take the time to show a veteran, no matter if they're 25 or 95, show them they're appreciated, let them know they made a great sacrifice, that you respect what they did.Rambo succeeds on this level, especially Stallones final speech to Richard Crenna, which absolutely tears you apart, realising this man was plucked from obscurity, trained to be a god amongst normal men, then, when the machine of war was done with him, tossed out like a little spring from the machine, useless, unneeded and no longer wanted... where was he to go? What was he to do? It's a realistic situation that many, many veterans go through, google War Veteran Suicide rate sometime, it's an eye opening somewhat depressing look at the reality of the situation regarding our beloved Vets and the torturous return to mundane civilian life they have to go through...Don't respect the war, don't necessarily respect your government.

Yet,don\'t let what others think of it trick you. As said by another reviewer,""First Blood"" is a classic.Based off of the 1972 novel by David Morell,""First Blood"" is about a former green beret of the Vietnam War,John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone). Despite the fact that John Rambo gave a strong service to America during the years that he fought in Vietnam,lately,Rambo finds his life falling apart. This is something that has personally torn John Rambo apart.And then,one day,things take a turn for the worse. This is when John Rambo is arrested by a sheriff in a small Alaska town(Hope),Will Teasle(Brian Dennehey)for vagrancy. Shortly thereafter,before John Rambo knows it,his patience and mental state are being put to a test. The result? John Rambo escaping from the police and launching a one-man war against them and the national guard. The only person who can help everyone get through it all? Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna),a close friend of John Rambo who served with Rambo in Vietnam.Let\'s talk about ""First Blood"" on the whole. Similar to 1988\'s ""Die Hard"" and 1993\'s ""The Fugitive"",""First Blood"" is one of the most well-written and adapted films (despite the several differences between the film and the novel). Not only is the action in ""First Blood"" perfect for any action film,it is quite suspenseful. It is not in the script just for the sake of being there. It is in the script because it needs to be there. The action in ""First Blood"" works well into the script,and is only to be found where it belongs.There is a lot of good drama and chemistry in ""First Blood"",as well. On top of everything that John Rambo has gone through in his life being richly executed drama that fits in well with the action in ""First Blood"",the scenes with the action are not just action scenes. They are scenes that contain action,drama,and chemistry. This is due to viewers of ""First Blood"" being able to watch John Rambo fight the Police and the National Guard with not only his weapons,but at the same time,his mind. The acting is in top shape,also. All of the actors in ""First Blood"" succeed in understanding their characters and bringing their characters to life with their performances. Especially Sylvester Stallone. Will Stallone ever have the presence and respect in Hollywood that actors like Paul Newman,Al Pacino,and Robert De Niro,plus several others,have earned and achieved? Surely and probably,no. But,in his performance as John Rambo,Stallone executes the drama that his performance requires. At the same time,Stallone does not fail to let the action in ""First Blood"" to be entertaining. He gives it the kind of action you would expect to see in any film that is reminiscent of ""First Blood"" (""Lethal Weapon"",""Die Hard"",etc.). All of this is what helps ""First Blood"" fully come together,and make it the great film that it is.Overall,a must see-film for fans of not only action films,but for fans of crime drama films,as well.10/10'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""A lot of people know the Rambo series as a ridiculous 80's action series.

From the multitude of explosions to the high body count to the unrealistic action to the ridiculous story line is completely absent. There are only 2 or 3 explosions (not to mention they are realistically done) and only one person dies throughout the whole picture. and the action, while there isn't a lot, it's realistic.

The only I have to complain about this movie is that the sequels were atrocious and painful. This is often looked over excellent movie that puts many other in the genre to shame. Many of you who find it boring are just gore junkies who thrive off of cheap explosions and a plethora of bullets in the air. Take it for a man trying to survive, not bringing down a whole army.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'If I\'m going to see the fourth installment of a film franchise, I should at least check out the one that started it all. That fact brings me to finally seeing the 80\'s classic First Blood. It wears its decade on its sleeve with the acting, broad humor at times, and cheesy credit song ""It\'s a Long Road."" Despite all that, though, the movie lives up to the hype and fires on all cylinders. I had no clue that the story pitted one Green Beret against a hick town of bigot cops. When I thought Rambo and I had visions of one-man wars versus countries or platoons of soldiers, not civilians out with a vendetta. Rambo just wanted a friend in the world that saw him fight for his country with honor and return home to heckling and protest. All he did overseas was spit on by his return and he became a stereotype drifter, an untouchable to society. The truth of that comes out when a Sheriff in Oregon sees him crossing the street and escorts him out of town, refusing to allow him to even have one meal. He kept pushing and pushing, enough so that Rambo just couldn\'t take anymore.As far as the premise goes, this one is quite effective. Based off a novel, I can see where the story would be strong despite the subsequent sequels for which I hear are horrible. To have a man beaten, on the brink of giving up on life, find his way back to the horrors he has been trying his hardest to forget is a clichd setup for sure, but it is all we need to set this thing in motion. With some nice quick cuts, we are shown the torture he endured in Vietnam juxtaposed with the handling by the local authorities on a trumped up vagrancy charge for looking unclean. They drew first blood and it is up to him to get himself out, with or without taking other people with him. Rambo understands that these people are civilians and decides to only incapacitate them rather than kill all in his wake. These are not the Viet Cong, they are like him, however, they know nothing about what he has gone through in order to allow them to sit back at home feeling free. If nothing else, this film is here to show people that no matter what your views on a war may be, no matter how much one thinks it is not our fight, if our troops are there, they deserve our full support. They are doing a job and a service that we are not willing to do ourselves as we sit and watch TV feeds, shaking our heads that it is all for nothing. If we give even one inch, they will take a mile, you can\'t lay down, ever. They fight for us and deserve to be treated as heroes.With all that said, can one really condone what John Rambo does in this film? No. Not even his old superior Colonel Trautman, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Creena, can accept what he is doing. He doesn\'t come in to set his boy free; he arrives to get him into custody so the fight will stop. The private war that has commenced needs to come with consequences. The punishment just needs to fit the crime. Rambo does nothing wrong except to hope for some shred of decency from humanity. That idealism is what causes all the trouble. Sheriff Teasle happens to be the straw that breaks the camel\'s back and all hell breaks loose. It is a matter of survival at first, but with the unrelenting pace, it soon turns into a search for justice by a warped mind doing the only job he knows how. I laughed when I heard the stats that the character kills just one person in this film. I mean how can Rambo, the ultimate badass, kill just one person? The laugh is on me, though, because I don\'t even count that one as his, it was the helicopter pilot\'s fault for jerking the aircraft. Rambo may destroy an entire town, but a cold-blooded murderer he is not\x97at least not until part two (with the great name of Rambo: First Blood II, a dual title that confuses the heck out of people on what the original truly was called).First Blood has become so entrenched in popular culture and the lexicon of cinema that even though I had never seen the film, I could swear I knew Creena\'s monologue about Rambo verbatim. I\'m sure it was parodied multiple times and probably shown at sporting events or something, but I just knew the entire speech\x97pretty crazy since I had never seen it before. Besides his nice turn during and after that sequence, we get a powerhouse performance from Brian Dennehy as the sheriff. This guy is good and it is too bad he was never used to full potential in the industry. Sure he did a lot of films, but nothing that he stood out from the pack with. As for the star, Sylvester Stallone shows why he was pound for pound the best action star of the 80\'s. Between this series and Rocky, he was stellar. From the charisma and shy modesty with which he begins the film, searching for his friend, to the stoic killing machine on the warpath, to the broken man unable to believe what has happened to the world around him, Sly runs the gamut effectively and perfectly. By far one of the best action films I\'ve seen, First Blood stands the test of time and delivers on the cult status it holds.

Dennehy is also superb as the chief pursuing officer, whose ragtag bunch of cops includes a small role for David Caruso.I really did like this movie.

Instead First Blood had a story...an important story...with a character that instilled itself into pop culture infamy forever and its easy to see why and how. First Blood is about stereotyping, profiling, exclusion, war and watching it nowadays makes it even more important than it was then or later on. With eye opening Vietnam films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Casualties of War and so forth First Blood did something that those films weren\'t able to do...take the exact same message and bring it to the mainstream public with one of the biggest stars of the day.

I suppose he could be considered the \'anti-hero\' but his actions are not saving anyone, and in fact hurting innocent people who can\'t possibly fight him but try to no avail anyways. Still the message is clear and it\'s a very story driven film with the creation of a movie icon.I\'ll argue with anyone, anytime...Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor AND a very talented writer. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. Stallone went way beyond the action genre and actually created John Rambo from personality and history and his movements, everything. In this first installment he laid the groundwork for Rambo. Quiet, brooding, scorned, angry, unstable, haunted, deeply emotional but buried beneath all these other emotions. I think that\'s a hell of a performance in my books. Brian Dennehy is Stallone\'s rival and does a terrific job playing the conceited and determined small town sheriff who will stop at nothing to bring Rambo down. The two of them have a terrific on screen chemistry and Dennehy is a first rate actor. Richard Crenna adds to the cast as Rambo\'s only true \'family\' and the one person he trusts. Crenna doesn\'t give a lot of variation to his performance, he\'s just kind of there to inform everyone of what Rambo is capable of. He is sort of monotoned and straight faced but he\'s a Rambo series staple and the character he plays is very important.Watch the end of this film closely for John Rambo\'s break down in the Grocery store when Traut (Crenna) tells him ""It\'s over."" You know the infamous line ""Not that it\'s over."" Watch the scene that follows and then tell me that you\'re not moved and blown away by Stallone\'s performance. It\'s real and it\'s important. First Blood by some will be considered untouchable by the rest because they see it for what it was likely meant to be...a drama...and important drama with a message but the film makers created this incredible character and by the time the film is done you\'re thinking one thing; I want to see this guy in his element in the action that they speak of and then you have the serializing of Rambo (which you will see by my review is NOT a bad thing.) I suppose I\'m judging First Blood on it\'s merit of being considered an action film because as great as Stallone is and how interesting the film is...I didn\'t find it mind blowingly entertaining. Still the film is well made an absolute classic and definitely worth seeing. If you\'re a huge Rambo fan then you can find a lot of hidden details about this mysterious man that Stallone created. It\'s a must see on any list. 8/10 **************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is a previous Green Beret who is forced to save himself from a redneck sheriff ( Brian Dennehy) and deputies ( Bill Mckinney , Jack Starrett, David Caruso ). Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully jailed and he pull off the break-out . The authorities set off in pursuit and he lead them into all type of dangerous , booby traps in the woods and mountains of the Oregon State . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping of innumerable risks and dangers . Former colonel (Richard Crenna) will attempt to stop and detain him .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it is fast movement for that reason the picture is quite entertaining. The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed in natural parks . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the anterior trainer officer. Appears unbilled Bruce Greenwood (JFK in Thirteen days ),almost extra ,and screen debut from David Caruso and Chris Mulkey . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by Andrew Laszlo filmed on location in Golden Ears Provincial Park,Hope, North Vancouver, Pitt Lake, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Splendid and magnificent musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith. The motion picture is followed by Rambo series : First blood II in which Rambo returns at Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war and Rambo III against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan . The trilogy was a completed by the recent Rambo , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand . The quartet was a complete success though the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans ; it's a movie for adrenaline lovers . Rating : Good , entertaining but violent . This exciting and moving motion picture is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this intelligent film still has its agreeable moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced picture attempts a special atmosphere with spectacular results. Two thumbs up""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Rambo is more than a cartoon character. He is the alter-ego of a generation. However, they could just as easily have dressed him in a suit and written nearly the same script. In that way, \'Rambo\' perpetuates the stereotyped Viet Nam War veteran as a semi-literate, underemployed drifting soul. Many of the clichd expressions used to describe John Rambo in the film are metaphors for the way real-life Vietnam War veteran were regarded: ""Crazy,"" ""psycho,"" ""loser,"" to name a few things that the character was called in the film. He added a few, (they called me)""...baby killer,"" ""In Nam I was somebody, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, I could drive a tank, fly a chopper. In the end, that he cried was out of character. Nonetheless, the character, \'John Rambo,\' did what many of us wanted to do, and many did in their own way: Smack society down for using us and throwing us away, scorned. The interesting thing to note is that the character, Sheriff Teasley, is played by Brian Dennehy, an actor who lied about serving in Viet Nam when he did not. Among veterans, lying about service in Viet Nam is a shameful act. Yet the many who have done so in some way supports the idea that Viet Nam, in the national conscience, was a heroic venture. It was.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""I, like many, have probably grown up with Rambo being a part of popular culture. From all those references to such an iconic character I was expecting some war film centered around an unstoppable killing machine. I was completely wrong, and thankfully so. Rambo is the story of a dark and troubled man. Rambo isn't a hero, but he should have been. He's a man that came home with no one to welcome him. He drifts from town to town, antagonised wherever he goes. One day a police force pushes him too far. Rambo's mental instabilities take hold and he pledges a war against these men in authority. There are no clearcut villains, and certainly no heroes here. We empathise with Rambo, and understand the police action taken against him. As well as being a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam Vets, it also shows how war isn't an excuse for such violent actions. Dennehy's wonderful character is shown (very subtly) as a soldier that managed to find his path. At the same time Dennehy doesn't know when to quit, his pride getting in the way. This is an action film with real substance, real issues, and real discussions to be had. It also never fails to deliver on the action, and Stallone's final emotional breakdown will relate to anyone that's been pushed too far. A film focused mostly on understanding, not excusing. I regret waiting this long to watch it.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""First Blood is that rare film that is not black and white instead it deals with areas of Gray. Stallone's Acting is Very Good maybe the Finest he's ever done outside of F.I.S.T. And Yet while his Rambo is a compelling portrait of a man slowly going insane trying to find something resembling peace. Rambo never finds it. All he finds is hatred and fear aimed at him and that makes them hostile towards him. The Main Villain in this if you can call him one is Police Chief Wil Teasle wonderfully played by Brian Dennehy. The interaction between the two is tense and that's before the shooting starts. But this is Stallone's movie and his Tour de force as he creates a complex character that many have a hard time separating from the Real Stallone. Richard Crenna Steals the Show as Colonel Sam Trautman United States Special Forces coming all the way from fort Bragge to come get his boy. Crenna underplays his role cool as anyone has a right to be. Together this cast sets off a match headed towards Kegs of Gunpowder and dynamite First Blood does not disappoint and it will stay with you long after you've seen it.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'My Rating : 8/10I am a huge fan of Sly and this right here is one of his best!This is my childhood movie I grew up with and will always have a special place in my heart. They drew first blood. THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""This is one of those films that was hugely popular back in the eighties but for some reason simply fell by the wayside and has effectively been forgotten about. Okay, while it isn't the movie that catapulted Stallone into stardom (that was Rocky), it certainly helped. Mind you, it is also one of the movies that also Stallone as a stereotypical tough guy that speaks more with his fists than with his mouth. However, as a film it is quite good, and certainly much better than the three sequels that came after it. In fact the sequels seemed to toss the whole purpose of this film to simply turn Rambo into your typical action hero whose job is to go out and rescue people.Anyway, the movie is about a former special forces officer who served in Vietnam but upon returning to America has simply become a drifter. In fact everybody who he knew as a family have simply died leaving him effectively alone in the world. So, he simply drifts from place to place, however one of those places happens to be a small town called Hope, and the Sheriff decides that he doesn't particularly want people like Rambo wandering through his town so he forcefully has him removed, and when Rambo doesn't comply he arrests him, takes him to the station and roughs him up a bit.Well, that happens to be a bad move because not only does it trigger a number of flash backs, but it also causes him to snap, beat up all of the occupants of the police station, and then flee into the mountains. Well, being the cocky small town police that they are they decide to go after Rambo alone, but pretty quickly discovered that that is definitely not a good idea since he takes out each and every one of them. Then, when the cavalry is called in, he not only manages to escape their trap, but takes the fight into town where we come to the dramatic conclusion.First Blood isn't your typical action movie by a long shot. Okay, you do technically have the bad guys in the form of the police, but the thing is that these police aren't corrupt in the sense that some police officers are but rather they are simply protective of their town to the point that they will push strangers around and politely ask them to leave if it seems as if they are going to cause trouble. Well, the problem is that when you push the wrong person around it has the potential to come back and bite you.The thing with this film is that it is about how the Vietnam Vets were treated when they returned home from war. It wasn't the heroes welcome that the WWII vets received, but rather they were ignored, and in some sense blamed, for the failure in Vietnam. This was America and they don't lose wars, but Vietnam was an effective loss, so it must have been the troops who were the reason that they lost. The thing is that this was a different type of war, and one that they Americans didn't adapt to at the time (though past experiences have demonstrated that they can fight a guerrilla war). However, that is not the issue in the film, it is the treatment of the vets that is.In a way they were left on the trash heap of society, and when they were able to pick themselves up out of it they were once again blamed for where they landed up. In many cases it was the World War II vets that were looking down on them because they too had been to war, and they had managed to transition back into civilian life, so if the Vietnam Vets weren't able to then maybe they weren't trying hard enough. However, as mentioned, Vietnam was a different type of war and as such the experiences that the Vets had over there were different to those that the WWII vets faced.Some people simply label First Blood as a mindless action film, but I would say that it is much, much more than that. It doesn't end the way a mindless action film ends, but rather confronts us with the alienation that Vietnam Vets face in the United States. It also confronts us with the bigotry of small town America, though you are no doubt going to find that in many small communities the world over. It challenges us to how we should look at working with our vets, and attempting to seek solutions to these problems than simply sweeping them under the rug. The thing is that no doubt there are going to be similar issues in relation to the vets of the Iraq War, and things no doubt have the potential to be much worse for them due to the hypercapitalist nature of the modern world.""}]"

Password,"[{'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': '""Password"" was one of those rare game shows in which contestants had to rely on mental abilities *other* than memory. Contestants on games such as ""Jeopardy"" and ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" rely on their memories, or those of others, to come up with answers.Unfortunately, the game placed people who do not have a great command of the English language at a disadvantage. People who have English as a second language may not have done too well in this game.Nevertheless, ""Password"" demanded that the contestant make an intellectual effort to take a word (idea) and convey it someone else. That kind of effort takes imagination and insight in the nuances of language to do well. It\'s a cerebral game; maybe that\'s why Allen Ludden said: ""Some time, somewhere, some day there will be another game show, but never one with the class of this one.""'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Every saturday, I watch the reruns of Password on Game Show Network.  I think this is a fun game to play and I like to make up my own games and play it with my family.  Allen Ludden (God rest his soul) was a very good host too.'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""Alan Ludden was truly a class act. One of a very few of the great game show hosts like Bill Cullen and Tom Kennedy. Password was a show that required the contestants to at least have a vocabulary--something that's sadly missing in today's game show world.I remember the last episode of Mr. Ludden's tenure--they drank champagne on air. Can anybody help me on this?: I was very young, but I seem to remember one of those 5 word bonus rounds they played with George Peppard--8 seconds! Am I right? Was this the record? Can't find any internet or you tube references. Anyone? Bueller?""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'Password was definitely a true classic as a well as a pioneer in the game show genre. It had all the elements for success. A simple format, home audience participation (if you didn\'t look at the word on the screen) and an outstanding host in Allen Ludden. He was the best game show host of all-time since he kept the game moving, treated both the celebrities and contestants very well and showed a lot of class. He was also one of the best dressed emcees and one of the first to wear open shirts.As a game show pioneer, Password was the first to pair contestants with celebrities and the first to use a bonus round, Without Password, there would have been no Pyramid. Both games were created by Bob Stewart.The original version would have lasted longer if CBS wouldn\'t have preempted the show on the same day The Newlywed Game debuted for a Vietnam War news conference. The Chuck Barris show cut into Password\'s dominance. Also, Fred Silverman, who headed CBS Daytime Programming was not a fan of game shows and he killed off classics such as I\'ve Got a Secret, What\'s My Line and Password. But fear not, the game was the first to air reruns and that led to the 70s revival on ABC.As for the 70s version, it was also ground breaking. It was the first network game show to be revived, though Goodson-Todman survived through a network game show drought with syndicated versions of What\'s My Line, To Tell the Truth and Beat the Clock and it was also the company\'s first show to be produced in Hollywood. When Password returned in 1971, the main game and Lightning Round remained the same. The only change was the addition of the Betting Word, where a contestant can double their winnings by guessing another password in 15 seconds. There was also an updated set and new theme music and of course, Allen Ludden as host. This version was a success for three years before the format became old and tired. Instead of cancelling the show, the producers changed the format and title to Password All Stars. An outstanding game was ruined by more complicated rules and the fact that game show fans like to see real people win money instead of celebrities playing for charities. Even Allen Ludden was uncomfortable with the new format. Eventually, the show went back to using civilian contestants but the game was still too complicated and was cancelled in June 1975. I\'ll always remember Allen Ludden closing each show with ""The password for today is...""'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': ""First off, I must say that this is a fun game show. Also, since I'm 24, I haven't seen every episode. However, I do know the show very well. Every time I've watched it, I've had a lot of fun playing along and watching. Despite the fact that it's finished its run, this makes me long to be a contestant. The thing I like most about it are the questions. Despite the fact that I don't know that many answers, I still have fun playing along. I hope the Game Show Network keeps it on so I can play along and watch again. If that happens, I will be really happy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.""}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'When I first discovered that ""Password"" reruns were airing on GSN a few years ago, I made it a point to get as many episodes on VHS as I could since there\'s no telling when the entire series will go into DVD. It\'s a pity that a lot of the game shows run on GSN don\'t have the class and continuity that ""Password"" did. Allen Ludden was always a great host - perfect for a game show like this. And like a lot of the game shows in the sixties and seventies, they made you think. I can also thank whoever made the decision at CBS to hang on to some of these great programs of that era such as ""Password"" for people to enjoy over again. I don\'t think the contestants were ever overawed by their celebrity partners and naturally we all found out how human they can be trying to think of a word to say in a few seconds from one-word clues. AND DON\'T EVER SAY THE PASSWORD AS A CLUE...OOPS!!!!'}, {'user': 'Yuvraj', 'date': '5-1-2019', 'cmnt': 'The excitement and fun of a retro game show can be found in ""Password,"" the famous TV game show where two teams, ""$100,000 Pyramid"" style, try to win big bucks. One person reads out a clue on a folded up piece of paper while the other person tries to guess the word. There are up to five clues revealed on the board above, and one team must figure out what the actual word really is!!!!! And now, my two favorite variations that currently run on GSN:""Password Plus:"" It stars Allen Ludden, who looked (no offense) really awful, like he always wore a raincoat to the show or something. Anyways, it had the most colorful set, and it had ""Alphabetics,"" which gave the contestant a chance at big bucks!!!!! I once saw a man go through it fast and correctly about a week ago and that was awesome!!!!!""Super Password:"" It stars Bert Convy and the set looked different, like a huge NES system; almost! Everything\'s the same, except that there\'s ""Ca$hword"" now. I also like how the word appears on screen and the noise that accompanies it!!!!!C\'mon, folks!!!!! These versions of ""Password"" meant good entertainment for everyone; this is stuff our parents (and us as little children) watched when they just got married!!!!!
